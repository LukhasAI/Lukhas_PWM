# Bio Systems

The Bio Systems directory contains specialized biological-inspired subsystems that provide advanced functionality for the LUKHAS AGI platform.

## Overview

This directory houses implementations that go beyond basic bio-inspired patterns to provide complete system-level functionality. Each subsystem here represents a major architectural component that integrates deeply with the LUKHAS core.

## Current Systems

### Orchestration

The orchestration system provides comprehensive resource management and module coordination using biological metaphors:

- **Location**: `orchestration/`
- **Purpose**: Unified bio-symbolic orchestration layer
- **Key Features**:
  - Energy-based resource allocation
  - Module health monitoring
  - Auto-repair capabilities
  - Oscillator synchronization
  - quantum-inspired processing

See [orchestration/README.md](orchestration/README.md) for detailed documentation.

## Architecture Principles

All bio systems follow these core principles:

1. **Biological Fidelity**: Accurate modeling of biological processes
2. **Scalability**: Designed to handle increasing complexity
3. **Integration**: Seamless connection with other LUKHAS modules
4. **Safety**: Built-in monitoring and fail-safes
5. **Adaptability**: Self-adjusting parameters based on conditions

## Future Systems

Planned additions to the bio systems directory:

- **Neural Networks**: Bio-realistic neural processing
- **Immune System**: Adaptive security and threat response
- **Endocrine System**: Hormonal regulation and long-term adaptation
- **Circulatory System**: Resource distribution networks
- **Sensory Systems**: Advanced perception and integration

## Integration Guidelines

When integrating with bio systems:

```python
# Import from the specific system
from lukhas.bio.systems.orchestration import BioOrchestrator

# Initialize with appropriate parameters
orchestrator = BioOrchestrator(
    total_energy_capacity=2.0,
    monitoring_interval=10.0
)

# Register your modules
orchestrator.register_module(
    'my_module',
    module_instance,
    priority=0.8
)
```

## Performance Considerations

- Bio systems are designed for efficiency but model complex processes
- Use appropriate monitoring intervals to balance accuracy vs performance
- Energy capacity should be tuned based on system load
- Auto-repair features add overhead but improve reliability

## Contributing

When adding new bio systems:

1. Create a dedicated directory under `bio/systems/`
2. Include comprehensive README documentation
3. Follow the established patterns (base classes, adapters, etc.)
4. Add integration tests
5. Update this README with the new system
