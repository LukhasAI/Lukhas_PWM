The core module processes these signals alongside user inputs to guide the AI's responses with empathy and understanding.

```python
# Interactive therapy session simulation
while True:
    user_input = input("How are you feeling today? ")
    if user_input.lower() == "exit":
        break
    
    # Process emotion and derive insight
    emotional_state = lukhas_core.analyze_emotion(user_input)
    response = lukhas_core.generate_response(emotional_state)
    print("AI Therapist:", response)
```
