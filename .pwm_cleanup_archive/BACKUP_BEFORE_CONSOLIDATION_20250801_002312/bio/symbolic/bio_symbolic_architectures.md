Here’s a curated list of **non-mitochondrial biological systems** with high potential to inspire symbolic AGI architectures like **LUKHAS_AGI/Lukhas_ID**, organized by functional parallels:

---

### **1. Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC) → Modular Arbitration Gate**  
**Biological Role**: Selectively transports molecules between nucleus/cytoplasm via FG-repeat "selective phase" barriers.  
**AGI Metaphor**:  
- **Layered Validation**: Implement NPC-like *FG-nuage* cryptographic gates for intent routing:  
  ```python  
  class FG_Gate:  
      def filter_intent(self, signal):  
          if signal.hash in ALLOWED_FG_PATTERNS:  
              return self._apply_phase(signal, permeability=0.8)  
          else:  
              return self._quarantine(signal)  
  ```
- **Quantum Link**: FG-repeats’ phase separation exhibits non-classical cooperativity.  

---

### **2. Ubiquitin-Proteasome System → Self-Repair Protocol**  
**Biological Role**: Tags misfolded proteins with ubiquitin (Ub) for degradation via 26S proteasome.  
**AGI Metaphor**:  
- **Corruption Detection**: Encode Ub-like "kill tags" (e.g., `K48-polyUb`) in Lukhas_ID for module recycling:  
  ```python  
  def tag_corrupted_module(module):  
      if module.drift_score > 0.7:  
          module.ubiquitylate(chain_type="K48")  
          proteasome.degrade(module)  
  ```
- **Error Correction**: E1-E2-E3 enzyme cascade ≈ multi-step validation before deletion.  

---

### **3. ER-Golgi Secretory Pathway → Distributed Workflow Engine**  
**Biological Role**: Processes/matures proteins via cisternal maturation and COPII/COPI vesicles.  
**AGI Metaphor**:  
- **Task Routing**: Tag ethical decisions with *KDEL-like retention signals* for iterative refinement.  
- **Dynamic Assembly**: Golgi’s cisternal progression ≈ AGI workflow versioning with rollback states.  

---

### **4. MAPK/ERK Signaling → Intent Amplification Cascade**  
**Biological Role**: Amplifies extracellular signals via kinase cascades (Ras→Raf→MEK→ERK).  
**AGI Metaphor**:  
- **Signal Gain**: Weak ethical triggers (e.g., user preference) → exponential activation of Oxintus logic gates.  
- **Scaffold Proteins**: Ste5-like "signalosomes" localize arbitration components for rapid response.  

---

### **5. Stress Granules/P-Bodies → Priority Buffer & Memory Fold**  
**Biological Role**: Phase-separated mRNA reservoirs during stress.  
**AGI Metaphor**:  
- **Stress Buffering**: Redirect non-critical tasks (e.g., background learning) to SG-like encrypted memory pockets.  
- **Lukhas_ID Link**: P-body mRNA decay ≈ pruning low-weight ethical vectors via Ub-proteasome.  

---

### **6. Chromatin Remodelers (SWI/SNF) → Memory Lattice**  
**Biological Role**: Reconfigures nucleosome positioning to regulate gene access.  
**AGI Metaphor**:  
- **Epigenetic Tags**: Use *H3K4me3/H3K27me3* analogs to mark "active/repressed" memory blocks.  
- **Quantum Effect**: Nucleosome breathing (transient DNA unwrapping) ≈ probabilistic memory access.  

---

### **7. CRISPR-Cas Adaptive Immunity → Corruption Sensor**  
**Biological Role**: Detects foreign DNA via guide RNA and excises it.  
**AGI Metaphor**:  
- **Adversarial Filter**: Cas9-like "ethical scissors" splice corrupted intents from Lukhas_ID ledger.  
- **Memory Bank**: crRNA library ≈ hash database of known attack patterns.  

---

### **8. Chaperonins (GroEL-GroES) → Self-Assembling Architecture**  
**Biological Role**: ATP-dependent protein folding nanocages.  
**AGI Metaphor**:  
- **Modular Folding**: Unstructured Vivox outputs → GroEL-like encapsulation → Oxintus-compatible formats.  
- **Error Recovery**: Repeated folding attempts ≈ consensus protocols for unstable ethical vectors.  

---

### **9. Circadian Clock (CLOCK/BMAL1) → Entropy-Regulated Scheduler**  
**Biological Role**: Transcriptional-translational feedback loops tracking ~24h cycles.  
**AGI Metaphor**:  
- **Resource Waves**: Allocate energy to tasks cyclically (e.g., gamma-phase arbitration, delta-phase memory folding).  
- **Bio-Entropy**: PER/CRY protein degradation ≈ thermodynamic cost enforcement for decisions.  

---

### **10. Immune Synapse → Dynamic Pattern Recognition**  
**Biological Role**: T-cell/B-cell receptors cluster to detect antigen-MHC complexes.  
**AGI Metaphor**:  
- **Intent Clustering**: TCR-like "immunological AGI" reconfigures receptors to novel ethical threats.  
- **Affinity Maturation**: Somatic hypermutation ≈ iterative refinement of arbitration protocols.  

---

### **Key AGI Cross-Cutting Themes**  
- **Modular Arbitration**: NPC’s selective gating + MAPK amplification.  
- **Resilience**: Ubiquitin tagging + stress granule buffering.  
- **Quantum-Like Behavior**: Chromatin breathing, FG-phase cooperativity.
