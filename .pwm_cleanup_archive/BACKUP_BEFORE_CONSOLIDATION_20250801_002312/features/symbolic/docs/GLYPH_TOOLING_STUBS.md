# LUKHAS Symbolic Glyph Tooling Stubs & Developer Interfaces

ΛTOOLING_STUBS_VERSION: 0.1.0
**Document Version**: 0.1.0 (Draft by Jules-06)
**Date**: $(date +%Y-%m-%d) <!-- Will be replaced by actual date -->
**Status**: DRAFT

## 1. Introduction & Purpose

This document outlines a blueprint for programmatic interfaces (stubs) that would enable developer tools, plugins, linters, and automated validation agents to interact with, query, and validate the LUKHAS symbolic glyph system. The goal is to bridge the conceptual framework of glyphs (defined in `GLYPH_MAP`, `GLYPH_CLASS_DICTIONARY.md`, etc.) with practical, automatable tooling.

**Why These Tooling Hooks Matter:**
-   **Automated Validation**: Enable linters or pre-commit hooks to check for glyph misuse based on `GLYPH_AUDIT_MACROS.md`.
-   **Enhanced Debugging**: Allow debuggers or IDEs to provide richer contextual information about glyphs (e.g., tooltips based on `GLYPH_VISUAL_DEBUG_LEGEND.md`).
-   **Developer Experience**: Simplify the discovery and correct usage of glyphs for developers.
-   **Agentic Validators**: Provide interfaces for future symbolic agents to monitor and report on glyph system integrity.
-   **Consistent Symbolic Representation**: Help ensure that glyphs are used and interpreted consistently across different tools and system outputs.

This document proposes conceptual stubs and interface patterns, not a concrete implementation.

## 2. Stub Categories & Descriptions

Proposed categories for tooling stubs:

1.  **🧩 Glyph Information & Lookup**:
    *   **Description**: Stubs for accessing core information about glyphs, their meanings, and their classifications from `GLYPH_MAP` and `GLYPH_CLASS_DICTIONARY.md`.
    *   **Use Cases**: IDE tooltips, documentation generators, interactive glyph browsers.

2.  **🧠 Contextual Validation & Audit Hook**:
    *   **Description**: Stubs that provide hooks for implementing the logic defined in `GLYPH_AUDIT_MACROS.md`. These would take contextual information (e.g., code snippet, log line, associated ΛTAGS) and return validation flags.
    *   **Use Cases**: Linters, pre-commit checks, runtime symbolic monitoring agents.

3.  **🧭 Symbolic Glyph Explorer API**:
    *   **Description**: Higher-level query interfaces for developers or tools to explore the glyph system, such as finding glyphs related to certain concepts, tags, or modules.
    *   **Use Cases**: Developer tools for symbolic discovery, impact analysis of glyph changes.

4.  **🔍 Glyph Presence Scanner**:
    *   **Description**: Utilities to find and extract glyphs from text content (code files, documentation, logs).
    *   **Use Cases**: Automated audits of glyph usage frequency, finding unlisted/rogue glyphs, metrics gathering.

5.  **🔐 Glyph Security Filter / Permission Gate (Optional)**:
    *   **Description**: Stubs for checking if the usage of certain sensitive glyphs (e.g., those indicating critical system states or ethical actions) is permissible in a given context or by a given actor/tier.
    *   **Use Cases**: Enhancing security around symbolic representation of critical operations.

## 3. Example Stub Signatures (Pseudocode / Python Interface Patterns)

These are conceptual signatures. Actual implementation details would vary.

## 4. Integration Points

These tooling stubs could be integrated into various parts of the LUKHAS ecosystem:

-   **IDE Plugins (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm)**:
    -   `get_glyph_details` for hover tooltips on glyphs in code/docs.
    -   `validate_glyph_usage` for real-time linting or gutter indicators.
    -   `suggest_glyphs_for_concept` for aiding developers in choosing appropriate glyphs.
-   **Linters & Static Analyzers (e.g., custom Pylint/Flake8 plugins)**:
    -   `validate_glyph_usage` to enforce symbolic hygiene in committed code and documentation.
    -   `find_glyphs_in_text` to report on usage of unlisted or deprecated glyphs.
-   **Pre-Commit Hooks**:
    -   Run `validate_glyph_usage` on staged changes to prevent problematic glyph patterns from entering the codebase.
-   **Runtime Diagnostic Dashboards & Monitoring Agents**:
    -   `get_glyph_details` and `get_glyphs_by_class` to enrich displayed information.
    -   `validate_glyph_usage` (adapted for runtime log analysis) to flag potential issues in operational logs.
-   **Symbolic Documentation Generators**:
    -   Use lookup stubs to automatically include glyph meanings or visual legend elements in generated documentation.
-   **Automated Test Suites**:
    -   `validate_glyph_usage` could be used to check that test logs or outputs use glyphs correctly according to defined states.

**Key Document Linkages**:
-   Relies heavily on data/definitions from:
    -   [`README_glyphs.md`](../README_glyphs.md) (for `GLYPH_MAP`)
    -   [`GLYPH_CLASS_DICTIONARY.md`](./GLYPH_CLASS_DICTIONARY.md)
    -   [`GLYPH_AUDIT_MACROS.md`](./GLYPH_AUDIT_MACROS.md)
-   Visual aspects would align with [`GLYPH_VISUAL_DEBUG_LEGEND.md`](./GLYPH_VISUAL_DEBUG_LEGEND.md).

## 5. Recommendations / Next Steps

-   **Prioritize Implementation**: Stubs like `get_glyph_details`, `get_glyphs_by_class`, and a basic `validate_glyph_usage` (initially focusing on one or two macros) would provide immediate value.
-   **Formalize as Modules**: Some stubs, particularly the information providers and scanners, could be formalized into Python modules within `core/symbolic/tooling/` (a new subdirectory).
-   **Develop a Proof-of-Concept Linter/Plugin**: Implementing a simple linter plugin for a common ΛTAG (e.g., checking for `#ΛDRIFT_POINT` 🌊 without a `WARNING` or `ERROR` log level) would demonstrate the utility.
-   **Interactive Glyph Browser Tool**: A simple web app or CLI tool using the "Symbolic Glyph Explorer API" stubs could help developers learn and use the glyph system.
-   **Collaboration with Jules-10 & Jules-12**:
    -   **Jules-10 (Documentation/Glossary)**: Ensure tooling outputs (like tooltips) are consistent with global glossaries.
    -   **Jules-12 (Validators/Pre-Commit Hooks)**: These stubs provide a direct blueprint for checks Jules-12 might implement.
