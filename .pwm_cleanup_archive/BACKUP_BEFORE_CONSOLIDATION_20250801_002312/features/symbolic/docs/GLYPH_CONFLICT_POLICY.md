# LUKHAS Symbolic Glyph Conflict Policy

**Version**: 0.1.0 (Draft by Jules-06)
**Date**: $(date +%Y-%m-%d) <!-- Will be replaced by actual date -->
**Status**: DRAFT

## 1. Introduction and Purpose

This document outlines the policy for managing and resolving conflicts within the LUKHAS symbolic glyph system, primarily governed by the `GLYPH_MAP` located in `core/symbolic/glyphs.py`. As the LUKHAS system evolves and its symbolic vocabulary expands, a clear policy is essential to maintain the clarity, consistency, and effectiveness of its visual symbolic language. This policy aims to provide guidelines for identifying, validating, and resolving glyph conflicts to ensure `#ŒõSYMBOLIC_UNITY`.

This policy should be referenced when proposing new glyphs or auditing the existing `GLYPH_MAP`.

## 2. Defining Glyph Conflict Types

Clear categorization of conflict types helps in diagnosing and resolving issues systematically.

| Conflict Type         | Description                                                                                                                              | Example                                                                                     |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Visual Collisions** | Two distinct glyphs are visually too similar, leading to potential misinterpretation, especially in varied fonts or small rendering sizes. | `‚úÖ` (Check Mark Button) vs. `‚úîÔ∏è` (Heavy Check Mark) if both intended for different meanings.  |
| **Semantic Overlap**  | Two or more different glyphs are used for concepts that are very similar or could be represented by a single, more encompassing glyph.      | Using both `üìà` (Chart Increasing) and `üëç` (Thumbs Up) for general "positive outcome".     |
| **Overloading Drift** | A single glyph is assigned to multiple, conceptually distinct ŒõTAGS or meanings without clear contextual disambiguation, diluting its specificity. | `üß†` being used for `#ŒõREASONING_LOGIC`, `#ŒõEMOTIONAL_STATE`, and `#ŒõCOGNITIVE_LOAD` simultaneously without context. |
| **Symbolic Ambiguity**| The meaning or interpretation of a glyph shifts significantly across different modules, domains, or contexts without explicit remapping or clarification. | `üåä` meaning minor drift in one module but critical data flow issues in another.           |

## 3. Glyph Validation Checklist (For New Glyph Proposals)

Before a new glyph is formally added to `GLYPH_MAP`, it should be validated against the following checklist. This process should ideally involve review by symbolic agents (e.g., Jules-06, Jules-09) or a designated symbolic governance body.

1.  **Visual Distinctness**:
    *   [ ] Is the proposed glyph visually distinct from all existing glyphs in `GLYPH_MAP` across common rendering platforms/fonts?
    *   [ ] Is it easily recognizable at various sizes?

2.  **Conceptual Alignment & Clarity**:
    *   [ ] Does the glyph intuitively and clearly represent its primary associated concept and intended ŒõTAG(s)?
    *   [ ] Is the proposed meaning concise and unambiguous?

3.  **Conflict Check with Existing `GLYPH_MAP`**:
    *   [ ] Does the glyph introduce any Visual Collisions with existing entries?
    *   [ ] Does its meaning create Semantic Overlap with existing glyph concepts?
    *   [ ] Could its addition lead to Overloading Drift for itself or other glyphs?

4.  **Contextual Consistency & Usage**:
    *   [ ] (If applicable) Has the glyph been prototyped or used consistently in at least two relevant modules or contexts to demonstrate its utility and fit? (More for community-driven additions).
    *   [ ] Is its meaning likely to remain stable across different LUKHAS domains, or is domain-specific clarification needed?

5.  **Representation & Fallback**:
    *   [ ] Does the glyph render reliably across standard Unicode-supporting systems?
    *   [ ] Is an ASCII or textual fallback representation necessary or desirable for environments where the glyph might not render (e.g., plain text logs, certain terminals)? Example: `(V)` for `‚úÖ`.

6.  **Cultural Sensitivity**:
    *   [ ] Has the glyph been checked for unintended negative cultural connotations or ambiguities across diverse user groups? (See Section 5.2)

## 4. Resolution Strategies for Glyph Conflicts

When a conflict is identified (either for a new proposal or an existing glyph), the following strategies can be employed:

1.  **üß© Reassignment / Deprecation**:
    *   **Action**: If a glyph causes significant Visual Collision or Semantic Overlap, or if a better glyph is found, the problematic glyph might be reassigned to a different concept, or deprecated.
    *   **Process**: Announce deprecation, provide a migration path to a new glyph if applicable, and eventually remove from active use. Update `GLYPH_MAP` with comments.

2.  **ü™û Symbolic Refraction (Contextual Variants)**:
    *   **Action**: For a glyph that has legitimate, subtly different meanings in different contexts (potential Overloading Drift or Symbolic Ambiguity), consider introducing minor visual variants or combining it with secondary modifier glyphs to encode contextual meaning.
    *   **Example**: `ü™û` (Self-Reflection) vs. `ü™û‚ú®` (Self-Reflection leading to Insight). This requires careful definition to avoid proliferation.
    *   **Caution**: Use sparingly to avoid overcomplicating the visual language.

3.  **üõ†Ô∏è Fallback Tags / Domain-Specific Mapping**:
    *   **Action**: If a glyph has a primary meaning but is also relevant to other ŒõTAGS in specific domains, allow the `GLYPH_MAP` entry to list primary and secondary associated ŒõTAGS. Documentation (e.g., module-specific READMEs) should clarify domain-specific interpretations if a glyph is intentionally overloaded.
    *   **Example**: `‚ò£Ô∏è` primarily for `#ŒõCORRUPT`, but in a biocomputing module, it might also relate to `#ŒõBIO_HAZARD_SIMULATION`. The `GLYPH_MAP` note should clarify this.

4.  **üß™ Mark as Experimental / Provisional**:
    *   **Action**: If a new glyph is proposed but has unresolved conflicts, questions about its utility, or potential for ambiguity, it can be added to `GLYPH_MAP` with an "experimental" or "provisional" status noted in its comment.
    *   **Process**: Such glyphs are subject to further review, community feedback, and potential change or removal. Their use in critical production systems should be limited.

5.  **Consensus & Documentation**:
    *   **Action**: All conflict resolutions and significant changes to glyph meanings must be documented in `GLYPH_MAP` (via comments), relevant READMEs, and potentially in this policy's addendum or changelog.
    *   **Process**: Aim for consensus among relevant symbolic agents or the governance body.

## 5. Versioning, Audits, and Governance

### 5.1. Policy and `GLYPH_MAP` Versioning
-   **Policy Version**: This document (`GLYPH_CONFLICT_POLICY.md`) will maintain its own version number at the top.
-   **`GLYPH_MAP` Versioning**: It is recommended to add a version constant to `core/symbolic/glyphs.py`, e.g.:
    ```python
    # ŒõCONSTANT
    GLYPH_POLICY_REFERENCE_VERSION = "0.1.0" # Indicates the version of GLYPH_CONFLICT_POLICY.md this map aligns with.
    GLYPH_MAP_VERSION = "1.2.0" # Incremented with each significant change to the map itself.
    ```
    This helps track compatibility and changes over time.

### 5.2. Glyph Audit Tasks
-   Symbolic agents (e.g., Jules-06, Jules-09, or future designated agents) should periodically audit the `GLYPH_MAP` and its usage across the LUKHAS codebase.
-   **Audit Scope**:
    -   Check for adherence to this conflict policy.
    -   Identify undocumented glyph usage or deviations from `GLYPH_MAP`.
    -   Review experimental glyphs for formalization or deprecation.
    -   Assess the overall coherence and effectiveness of the glyph system.
-   Audit findings should be logged, and necessary refactoring tasks created.

## 6. Optional Considerations

### 6.1. ‚ùå Banned Glyphs List (Placeholder)
A list of glyphs that should NOT be used in `GLYPH_MAP` could be maintained if certain symbols are reserved for OS-level functions, specific UI frameworks, or have strong, universally negative/misleading connotations unrelated to LUKHAS. (No entries currently).

### 6.2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Cultural Sensitivity Note
LUKHAS aims to be a globally relevant system. Glyphs chosen should, as much as possible, be universally understandable or neutral. Avoid glyphs with strong, specific cultural, religious, or political connotations unless their use is explicitly justified, documented, and reviewed for potential misinterpretation across diverse user groups. When in doubt, opt for more abstract or universally recognized symbols.
