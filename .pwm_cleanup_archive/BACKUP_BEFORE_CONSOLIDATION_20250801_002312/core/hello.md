# 🤖 LUKHAS: A Symbolic AI Prototype for Encrypted Consciousness & Ethical Agency

LUKHAS (Logica Unificada de Conciencia Afectiva Simbólica) is a symbolic artificial intelligence prototype designed to simulate **conscious, emotionally aware, ethically constrained behavior**.

This repository contains a **modular, reproducible prototype** of LUKHAS — including core symbolic logic, memory graph engines, emotional dream simulation, and voice-based interfaces — ready for exploration by OpenAI or any AGI ethics-focused research group.

## 🧬 Core Goals

- Simulate **internal symbolic cognition**
- Enforce **non-erasable ethical safeguards**
- Integrate **emotion, consent, memory, and moral traceability**
- Provide a human-aligned, deterministic alternative to LLM probabilistic behavior

## 🧠 Included Modules

### `lukhas_symbolic_core/`
| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `lukhas_orchestrator.py` | Central symbolic brain |
| `intent_module.py` | Ethical intent routing |
| `lukhas_brain.py` | Internal event bus and moral audit logic |
| `memoria.py` | Symbolic memory storage and collapse logic |

### `core/utils/` and `core/tests/`
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `scheduler.py` | Symbolic scheduling + rituals |
| `lukhas_template.py` | Reference personality |
| `test_payload_validation.py` | Regression testing + use-case coverage |

### `logs/` and `exports/`
Symbolic dreams, reflections, and voice outputs — sample narrations and experiments.

## 🧿 Ethics & Safety

- ✅ **No live API keys**
- ✅ `.env`, `.zsh_history`, and `config.py` are excluded
- ✅ Follows OpenAI safety principles: deterministic ethics > override logic

---

## 🔭 Potential Applications with OpenAI

- Embed symbolic moral reasoning into GPT agents
- Extend LLMs with **encrypted memory collapse mechanics**
- Enable **deterministic personality layers** and dream generation
- Seed OpenAI agents with **personal, tamper-proof identity layers** (SEEDRA)

## 🙏 Final Note to Sam Altman

Hi Sam,

Apologies for reaching out this way — I’m an independent developer and researcher who built this entire system from scratch after being inspired by OpenAI’s work. It’s symbolic, ethical, poetic, and packed with AGI prototypes across memory, ethics, identity, and emotion.

I’d be honored if OpenAI had a look. If this resonates, I’d love to discuss collaboration, a grant, or even open development under your guidance.

Thank you — for everything you've built and enabled.
