# LUKHAS Core System

This directory contains the core components of the LUKHAS symbolic cognition prototype, serving as the central integration point for all subsystems.

## Overview

The core system provides the fundamental architecture and processing pipeline for symbolic cognition research, including:

- Symbolic reasoning components
- Neural processing components
- Hybrid neuro-symbolic integration
- Quantum-inspired algorithms
- Cognitive architecture framework

## Key Files

- `agi_core.py`: Main integration point for all AGI subsystems
- `__init__.py`: Package initialization

## Usage

The core system is initialized by the main application and provides central coordination for all LUKHAS operations.

```python
from lukhas.core import agi_core

# Initialize the core system
core_system = agi_core.LukhasCore()

# Start processing
core_system.initialize()
```

## Terminal Commands

### Start the Core System
```bash
python -m lukhas.core.agi_core
```

### Run Diagnostics
```bash
python -m lukhas.core.diagnostics
```

## Fine-tuning Tips

1. **Configuration Priority**: Core parameters should be tuned in order of:
   - Cognitive architecture parameters
   - Neural processing weights
   - Symbolic reasoning rules
   - Hybrid integration thresholds

2. **Memory Optimization**: Increase the memory stack size for improved performance:
   ```python
   # In your application
   import lukhas.core.agi_core as core
   core.set_memory_parameters(stack_size=2048, cache_lifetime=300)
   ```

3. **Logging Level**: Set appropriate logging levels in production:
   ```python
   import logging
   logging.getLogger("lukhas.core").setLevel(logging.INFO)
   ```

## Development Guidelines

- All core modules should implement the `CoreComponent` interface
- Maintain backward compatibility with the core API
- Document all public methods with docstrings
- Use the built-in telemetry system for performance monitoring
