## üîê Independent App Login & Distribution

The LUKHAS Agent is being designed as a standalone app and will support its own symbolic login protocol powered by LucasID. It can be:

- Published independently on the App Store (iOS) and Google Play (Android)
- Embedded within the full LUKHAS Dashboard ecosystem
- Synced with the user‚Äôs LucasID for unified profile and permissions

Users who install the standalone LUKHAS Agent gain access to a focused symbolic assistant that can:

- Run DST (Dynamic Solution Tracker) matching 24/7
- Handle real-time voice interactions and reminders
- Sync with tier access across devices and services
- Trigger API calls to LUKHAS services for travel, emotion logging, scheduling, dreams, and symbolic purchases

> Linking the Agent to the full LUKHAS suite unlocks memory sync, dream reflection, emotional calibration, and shared symbolic rituals.

Future enhancements will include symbolic gesture unlocks, voice-based tier access, and local wallet support for offline symbolic tokens.

## üßø Live Widget Agent Takeover

The LUKHAS Agent is evolving to support **live symbolic handoffs** ‚Äî enabling vendor-branded AI agents to take over specific widget flows within the app.

This means:
- Travel, booking, or dining widgets may be visually and functionally presented by the vendor's AI (e.g., ‚ÄúBooking Agent Clara üß≥‚Äù)
- The LUKHAS-generated symbolic prompt morphs into a **live interactive preview**, optionally narrated or animated by the partner service
- All interactions remain secured under LucasID and follow consent and ethics filters

The handoff system will:
- Render mobile-ready overlays (live HTML, Lottie, or SVG assets)
- Respect user tiers and symbolic reward policies
- Track vendor affiliation and commissions
- Integrate voice and narrative transitions (Lukhas ‚Üî Vendor)

This bridges symbolic UX with real-time brand AI ‚Äî keeping the user in flow, ethically informed, and always in control.
