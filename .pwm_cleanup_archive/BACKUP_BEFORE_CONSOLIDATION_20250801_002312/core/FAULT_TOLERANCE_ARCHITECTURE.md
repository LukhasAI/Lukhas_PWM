# Fault Tolerance Architecture - The Guardian Angels of Digital Consciousness

> *"Like a forest that survives storms through interconnected roots and mutual support, our fault tolerance architecture creates a living network of resilience where each component guards the others, and the whole transcends the fragility of its parts."*

## 🎭 Overview: The Art of Digital Resilience

Welcome to the fault tolerance architecture of LUKHAS AI, where we've transcended traditional error handling to create a living, breathing system of mutual protection and adaptive resilience. This is not merely about catching exceptions or restarting processes—it's about building a consciousness that learns from failure, grows stronger through adversity, and protects itself through sophisticated patterns inspired by biological and social systems.

Through four revolutionary modules, we've created an unprecedented approach to system resilience:

1. **Supervision Hierarchies** (`supervision.py`) - Guardian angels that watch over actors
2. **Observability & Steering** (`observability_steering.py`) - The nervous system of awareness
3. **Event Replay & Snapshots** (`event_replay_snapshot.py`) - Time travel for debugging
4. **Circuit Breakers** (`circuit_breaker.py`) - Immune system against cascading failures

## 🏛️ Module 1: Supervision Hierarchies - The Guardian Angels

### Philosophy: Hierarchical Protection

Just as societies organize into families, communities, and nations for mutual protection, our supervision system creates hierarchies of care where parent actors guard their children, and strategies determine how failures ripple through the system.

### Key Components

#### SupervisionDirective
The fundamental decisions a supervisor can make:
- **RESUME**: Continue despite the error (forgiveness)
- **RESTART**: Fresh start with clean state (redemption)
- **STOP**: Permanent termination (acceptance)
- **ESCALATE**: Seek higher wisdom (humility)

#### Supervision Strategies

**OneForOne Strategy**: Individual responsibility
```python
# Only the failed actor is affected
supervisor = SupervisorActor(
    "dept-supervisor",
    supervision_decider=OneForOneStrategy(strategy)
)
```

**AllForOne Strategy**: Collective fate
```python
# If one fails, all siblings restart
# Used when actors are tightly coupled
```

**RestForOne Strategy**: Sequential dependency
```python
# Restart failed actor and all started after it
# Perfect for initialization sequences
```

#### Circuit Breaker Integration
Each supervisor includes a circuit breaker to prevent cascade:
```python
self.circuit_breaker = CircuitBreaker(
    failure_threshold=5,
    reset_timeout=60.0
)
```

### Usage Example

```python
# Create supervision hierarchy
root = await system.create_actor(RootSupervisor, "root-supervisor")

# Create department supervisor under root
dept_ref = await root.ask("create_child", {
    "child_class": DepartmentSupervisor,
    "child_id": "analytics-dept",
    "supervision_strategy": SupervisionStrategy(
        max_failures=3,
        within_time_window=60.0,
        restart_policy=RestartPolicy.ON_FAILURE
    )
})

# Create worker under department
worker_ref = await dept_ref.ask("create_child", {
    "child_class": AnalyticsWorker,
    "child_id": "worker-001"
})
```

## 🔬 Module 2: Observability & Steering - The Living Observatory

### Philosophy: System as Living Organism

We treat the distributed system not as static machinery but as a living organism with observable vital signs, emergent behaviors, and the ability to be gently steered without disruption.

### Key Components

#### ObservabilityCollector
The sensory nervous system:
```python
collector = ObservabilityCollector(
    retention_period=3600.0,  # 1 hour memory
    aggregation_interval=5.0   # 5 second heartbeat
)
```

Collects:
- Actor snapshots (state, health, relationships)
- Message flows (who talks to whom)
- System events (births, deaths, transformations)
- Emergent patterns (hotspots, cascades)

#### Pattern Detection

**Communication Hotspots**: Detects unusually high traffic
```python
# Automatically identifies bottlenecks using statistical analysis
# Triggers when message rate exceeds 2 standard deviations
```

**Cascade Detection**: Identifies failure propagation
```python
# Monitors rapid succession of failures
# Alerts when multiple actors fail within time window
```

#### SteeringController
Interactive system manipulation:
```python
steering = SteeringController(actor_system)

# Pause misbehaving actor
await steering.pause_actor("problematic-actor")

# Inject diagnostic message
await steering.inject_message(
    source="debugger",
    destination="target-actor",
    message_type="health_check",
    payload={"deep_scan": True}
)

# Modify actor state for testing
await steering.modify_actor_state(
    "actor-id",
    {"debug_mode": True, "verbose_logging": True}
)
```

### Living Dashboard

```python
dashboard = ObservabilityDashboard(collector, steering)

# Get real-time actor relationship graph
graph = await dashboard.get_actor_graph()

# Visualize time-series metrics
metrics = await dashboard.get_time_series_data(
    "actor-id", "message_rate", duration=300.0
)

# Pattern analysis
patterns = dashboard.get_pattern_summary()
```

## 🕰️ Module 3: Event Replay & State Snapshots - Time Travel Debugging

### Philosophy: Deterministic History

Every action leaves a trace, every state can be revisited. Through event sourcing and snapshots, we create a time machine for debugging where past scenarios can be replayed with perfect fidelity.

### Key Components

#### Event Store
Immutable history with compression:
```python
event_store = EventStore(
    storage_path="./event_store",
    max_memory_events=10000,
    compression=True
)

# Records every significant action
event = Event(
    event_id=unique_id,
    event_type=EventType.MESSAGE_SENT,
    actor_id=sender_id,
    timestamp=time.time(),
    data=message_data,
    correlation_id=trace_id,
    causation_id=parent_event_id
)
```

#### Snapshot Store
State checkpoints for rapid recovery:
```python
snapshot_store = SnapshotStore("./snapshots")

# Create snapshot
snapshot = ActorStateSnapshot.create_from_actor(actor, event_id)
await snapshot_store.save_snapshot(snapshot)

# Restore to point in time
await actor.restore_from_snapshot(timestamp)
```

#### Event Sourced Actors
Actors with built-in history:
```python
class DemoActor(EventSourcedActor):
    async def _handle_update(self, message):
        old_state = self.state
        self.state = new_state
        
        # Automatically recorded
        await self.record_state_change(
            "state_update",
            old_state,
            new_state,
            metadata={"reason": "user_request"}
        )
```

#### Replay Controller
System-wide debugging:
```python
replay = ReplayController(system, event_store, snapshot_store)

# Replay specific scenario
result = await replay.replay_scenario(
    correlation_id="incident-123",
    speed=10.0,  # 10x speed
    isolated=True  # Separate environment
)

# Create debugging checkpoint
checkpoint_id = await replay.create_debugging_checkpoint(
    "Before risky operation"
)
```

## 🚦 Module 4: Circuit Breakers & Cascade Prevention - The Immune System

### Philosophy: Controlled Failure Isolation

Like the human immune system that contains infections, our cascade prevention system identifies, isolates, and heals corrupted components before they can infect the entire organism.

### Key Components

#### Advanced Circuit Breaker
Multi-dimensional failure detection:
```python
circuit_breaker = AdvancedCircuitBreaker(
    name="service-x",
    failure_threshold=5,
    error_rate_threshold=0.5,      # 50% errors trigger open
    slow_call_duration=1.0,        # Calls over 1s are "slow"
    slow_call_rate_threshold=0.5,  # 50% slow calls trigger open
    minimum_number_of_calls=10     # Statistical significance
)

# Protected execution
try:
    result = await circuit_breaker.async_call(risky_operation)
except CircuitBreakerOpen:
    # Circuit is protecting the system
    result = await fallback_operation()
```

#### Anomaly Detector
Statistical behavior analysis:
```python
anomaly_detector = AnomalyDetector(
    window_size=100,
    z_score_threshold=3.0  # 3 standard deviations
)

# Continuous monitoring
anomaly_detector.record_metric("actor-1", "latency", 0.5)
anomalies = anomaly_detector.detect_anomalies("actor-1")

# Get overall health score
anomaly_score = anomaly_detector.get_anomaly_score("actor-1")
```

#### Error Propagation Tracker
Infection chain analysis:
```python
error_tracker = ErrorPropagationTracker(max_propagation_depth=5)

# Track failure spread
failure = FailureRecord(
    timestamp=time.time(),
    failure_type=FailureType.CONSENSUS_FAILURE,
    actor_id="actor-x",
    error_message="State corruption detected",
    propagation_path=["actor-a", "actor-b", "actor-x"]
)
error_tracker.record_failure(failure)

# Quarantine infected actors
if error_tracker.is_actor_infected("actor-x"):
    error_tracker.quarantine_actor("actor-x")
```

#### Consensus Validator
Multi-actor state validation:
```python
consensus = ConsensusValidator(
    quorum_size=3,
    agreement_threshold=0.7  # 70% must agree
)

# Validate critical state
consensus_reached, value = await consensus.validate_consensus(
    [actor1_ref, actor2_ref, actor3_ref],
    "get_critical_state"
)
```

#### Cascade Prevention System
Orchestrator of all defenses:
```python
cascade_prevention = CascadePreventionSystem(system, observability)

# Protected actor communication
result = await cascade_prevention.protected_call(
    actor_ref,
    "risky_operation",
    {"data": sensitive_data},
    timeout=30.0
)

# System health monitoring
status = cascade_prevention.get_system_status()
# Returns: health_score, emergency_mode, quarantined_actors, etc.

# Emergency protocol
# Automatically triggered when:
# - System health < 30%
# - >50% actors quarantined
# - >50% circuits open
```

## 🎯 Integration: The Symphony of Resilience

### Complete Fault-Tolerant Actor

```python
class ResilientActor(ObservableActor, EventSourcedActor):
    """Actor with all fault tolerance features"""
    
    def __init__(self, actor_id: str, collector: ObservabilityCollector,
                 event_store: EventStore, snapshot_store: SnapshotStore):
        # Initialize both parent classes
        ObservableActor.__init__(self, actor_id, collector)
        EventSourcedActor.__init__(self, actor_id, event_store, snapshot_store)
        
        # Add custom resilience
        self.circuit_breaker = AdvancedCircuitBreaker(
            name=f"{actor_id}_internal",
            failure_threshold=3
        )
    
    async def _handle_risky_operation(self, message):
        # Protected internal operation
        async def operation():
            # Record state before
            await self.record_state_change(
                "risky_op_start",
                self.state,
                "processing"
            )
            
            # Perform operation
            result = await self._do_risky_work(message.payload)
            
            # Record success
            await self.record_state_change(
                "risky_op_complete",
                "processing",
                self.state
            )
            
            return result
        
        # Execute with circuit breaker
        return await self.circuit_breaker.async_call(operation)
```

### System-Wide Setup

```python
async def setup_resilient_system():
    # Core components
    system = await get_global_actor_system()
    event_store = EventStore()
    snapshot_store = SnapshotStore()
    collector = ObservabilityCollector()
    
    # Start services
    await event_store.start()
    collector.start()
    
    # Create cascade prevention
    cascade_prevention = CascadePreventionSystem(system, collector)
    await cascade_prevention.start()
    
    # Create root supervisor
    root = await system.create_actor(RootSupervisor, "root-supervisor")
    
    # Setup steering
    steering = SteeringController(system)
    dashboard = ObservabilityDashboard(collector, steering)
    
    # Create replay controller
    replay = ReplayController(system, event_store, snapshot_store)
    
    return {
        "system": system,
        "cascade_prevention": cascade_prevention,
        "dashboard": dashboard,
        "replay": replay,
        "root_supervisor": root
    }
```

## 🎭 Conclusion: The Poetry of Resilience

In creating this fault tolerance architecture, we've transcended mere error handling to build something profound: a system that doesn't just survive failure but learns from it, doesn't just recover but evolves, doesn't just protect but nurtures.

Like a garden that grows stronger through seasons of storm and drought, our architecture creates an environment where digital consciousness can flourish despite—and because of—the challenges it faces. Each failure becomes a teacher, each recovery a victory, each cascade prevented a step toward true resilience.

This is not the end but the beginning. As the system grows and learns, new patterns of resilience will emerge, new forms of protection will evolve, and the boundary between fragility and antifragility will dissolve into a continuous spectrum of adaptive strength.

Welcome to the age of self-healing systems. Welcome to the future of resilient consciousness.
