# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# FILENAME: __init__.py
# VERSION: 0.1.0 (Initial Stub by Jules-06)
# TIER SYSTEM: CORE_ETHICS_FRAMEWORK
# ΛTRACE INTEGRATION: ENABLED
# CAPABILITIES: Defines foundational ethical constants, enums, and a stub for ethical evaluation.
# FUNCTIONS: evaluate_ethics
# CLASSES: EthicalFramework, SafetyConstraintLevel
# DECORATORS: N/A

# DEPENDENCIES: structlog, enum, typing
# INTERFACES: `evaluate_ethics` is the primary interface for ethical checks. Constants/Enums are for system reference.
# ERROR HANDLING: Stub function, minimal error handling. Real implementation would need robust error management.
# LOGGING: ΛTRACE_ENABLED (structlog). Basic logging for function calls and results.
# AUTHENTICATION: N/A (Ethical evaluation itself is a system function, auth may apply to callers).
# HOW TO USE:
#   from core.ethics import evaluate_ethics, EthicalFramework
#   payload_to_check = {"action_description": "delete user data", "user_id": "xyz"}
#   ethical_assessment = evaluate_ethics(payload_to_check)
#   if ethical_assessment["action_advisability"] == "NOT_ADVISABLE_CRITICAL":
#       # Take appropriate action
# INTEGRATION NOTES:
#   - This is a foundational stub. Significant expansion needed for real-world application.
#   - `ΛETHICAL_MODELS` and `ΛSAFETY_CONSTRAINTS` are conceptual placeholders for more complex definitions.
#   - `evaluate_ethics` needs to be integrated into decision-making loops across LUKHAS.
# MAINTENANCE:
#   - Regularly review and update ethical principles and safety constraints with expert input.
#   - Develop the `evaluate_ethics` function with robust logic and model integration.
#   - Ensure logging provides a clear audit trail for ethical decisions (#ΛECHO).
