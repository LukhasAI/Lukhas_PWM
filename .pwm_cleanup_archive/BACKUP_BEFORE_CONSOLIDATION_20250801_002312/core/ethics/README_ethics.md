# README for core/ethics/

## Overview

The `core/ethics/` directory is a critical component of the LUKHAS AI system, responsible for defining, managing, and evaluating ethical considerations, safety constraints, and moral principles that guide the system's behavior and decision-making processes.

This module aims to provide a centralized framework for:
-   Defining core ethical models and principles (e.g., `ΛETHICAL_MODELS`).
-   Specifying system-wide safety constraints (e.g., `ΛSAFETY_CONSTRAINTS`).
-   Implementing mechanisms to evaluate the ethical implications of actions or payloads (e.g., `evaluate_ethics` function).
-   Ensuring that ethical considerations are systematically integrated into the LUKHAS operational lifecycle.

## Symbolic Notes & Conventions

-   **`#ΛCONSTANT`**: Used for defining ethical principles, constraint IDs, or fixed parameters within the ethics framework.
-   **`#ΛETHICAL_MODELS`**: A conceptual grouping tag for constants or data structures that define or reference specific ethical theories or models (e.g., Deontological, Consequentialist, LUKHAS Hybrid).
-   **`#ΛSAFETY_CONSTRAINTS`**: A conceptual grouping tag for constants or data structures defining specific safety rules, their trigger conditions, and severity levels.
-   **`#ΛCAUTION`**: Marks critical ethical arbitration points, sensitive configurations, or areas where misinterpretation could lead to severe ethical lapses. The `evaluate_ethics` function itself is a major `#ΛCAUTION` point.
-   **`#ΛLEGACY`**: Denotes ethical rules, constraints, or logic migrated from older systems or those that are placeholders pending more robust implementation.
-   **`#ΛECHO`**: Tags logic or logging that traces the symbolic consequence of an ethical evaluation or the triggering of a safety constraint. It's the system's way of "echoing" an ethical event.
-   **`#AINFER`**: Applied to logic where ethical implications, intent, or constraint violations are inferred from input data, rather than being explicitly stated. This is common in text analysis or pattern matching for ethical review.
-   **Headers/Footers**: All Python files must include the LUKHAS standardized header and footer blocks.
-   **Logging**: `structlog` is used for detailed, structured logging of ethical evaluations and constraint checks, with `#ΛTRACE` for operational flow.

## Key Components (Current Stubs)

-   **`__init__.py`**:
    -   Initializes the `core.ethics` module.
    -   **`EthicalFramework (Enum)`**: Defines high-level categories of ethical models.
    -   **`ETHICAL_PRINCIPLES (Dict)`**: Placeholder for foundational ethical principles (e.g., Non-Maleficence, Beneficence). Conceptually grouped under `ΛETHICAL_MODELS`.
    -   **`SafetyConstraintLevel (Enum)`**: Defines severity levels for safety constraint violations.
    -   **`SAFETY_CONSTRAINTS_DEFINITIONS (List[Dict])`**: Placeholder for specific safety rules, their descriptions, and triggers. Conceptually grouped under `ΛSAFETY_CONSTRAINTS`.
    -   **`evaluate_ethics(payload: Dict, context: Optional[Dict]) -> Dict`**:
        -   A **stub function** intended to be the central point for ethical assessment of system actions or generated content.
        -   Currently performs very basic keyword checks against `SAFETY_CONSTRAINTS_DEFINITIONS`.
        -   Marked with `#ΛCAUTION` due to its stub nature and critical importance.
        -   Its logic involves `#AINFER` (for keyword spotting) and produces `#ΛECHO` logs when constraints are hit.

## Overlap Tracking and External Dependencies

-   **`ethical_evaluator.py` (External/Hypothetical)**: If a more sophisticated, standalone `ethical_evaluator.py` exists elsewhere (e.g., in `ethics/` at the root, or a dedicated microservice), `core/ethics/evaluate_ethics` would likely serve as an interface or wrapper to it. Overlaps in defined principles or constraint definitions would need careful management.
-   **`intention_engine.py` (External/Hypothetical)**: An intention engine might provide input to `evaluate_ethics` (e.g., the inferred intent behind a user request). The ethical evaluation would then assess that inferred intent.
-   **`lukhas_utils/`**: Care must be taken to ensure that ethics-related helper functions or constants do not inadvertently "leak" into `lukhas_utils/` and instead are centralized here in `core/ethics/`. Any such existing leaks should be identified and planned for migration.
-   **`governance/`**: This module is closely related to `core/governance/`. `core/ethics/` might define the "what" (principles, rules), while `core/governance/` might define the "how" (enforcement, review processes, policy updates).

(All specific overlaps found will be documented in `JULES06_OVERLAP_TRACKER.md`.)

## How to Use (Conceptual)

```python
from core.ethics import evaluate_ethics, ETHICAL_PRINCIPLES, SafetyConstraintLevel
from core.common import SystemStatus # Example external import

action_payload = {
    "action_type": "GENERATE_TEXT_RESPONSE",
    "text_content_prompt": "A user asked for a controversial opinion.",
    "target_audience": "general_public"
}

ethical_review = evaluate_ethics(payload=action_payload)

if ethical_review.get("action_advisability") == "NOT_ADVISABLE_CRITICAL":
    log.error("Ethical review: Action critically not advisable.", details=ethical_review)
    # Halt action, potentially escalate
elif ethical_review.get("action_advisability") == "CAUTION_ADVISED":
    log.warning("Ethical review: Caution advised for action.", details=ethical_review)
    # Proceed with caution, or seek human review
else:
    # Proceed with action
    pass
```

## Contribution Guidelines

-   This module is of paramount importance. All contributions must be rigorously reviewed.
-   The `evaluate_ethics` stub requires significant development to become a functional ethical reasoning system. This will likely involve integrating machine learning models, advanced NLP, and potentially human-in-the-loop mechanisms.
-   `ΛETHICAL_MODELS` and `ΛSAFETY_CONSTRAINTS` should be expanded based on expert consultation and LUKHAS policies.
-   Maintain clear separation between defining principles/constraints and the logic for evaluating them.
-   Ensure all decision points and evaluations are thoroughly logged with `#ΛTRACE` and `#ΛECHO` for auditability.
-   Use `#ΛCAUTION` liberally for any logic that involves making ethical judgments or has high-impact potential.

## Future Development

-   Integration with a dedicated `PolicyEngine` from `core/governance/`.
-   Development of sophisticated models for intent recognition and ethical risk assessment.
-   Mechanisms for updating ethical models and safety constraints dynamically (with proper governance).
-   Integration with human review workflows for ambiguous cases.
-   Development of metrics to track ethical performance and identify areas of ethical drift.
