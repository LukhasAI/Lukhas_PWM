Agent 1 Task 13: Symbolic Tracer Integration Test Suite
========================================================

Tests the integration of features/symbolic/tracer.py with reasoning/reasoning_engine.py.
Validates that SymbolicTracer is properly integrated and provides decision trail tracking.

Test Coverage:
- SymbolicTracer import and initialization in SymbolicEngine
- Decision trail creation and management
- Symbolic event tracing during reasoning
- Interface method functionality
- Error handling and fallback behavior
- Full reasoning process with trace logging
