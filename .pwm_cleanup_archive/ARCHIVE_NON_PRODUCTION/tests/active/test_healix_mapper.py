# VERSION: 1.0.0
# TIER SYSTEM: Not applicable (Test Script)
# ΛTRACE INTEGRATION: ENABLED
# CAPABILITIES: Unit tests for HealixMapper, verifying its ability to map helix
#               structures from memory and find resonant memories, using mocked
#               accent and emotion engine dependencies.
# FUNCTIONS: mock_mapper_instance (fixture), test_map_helix_from_memory,
#            test_find_resonant_memories.
# CLASSES: None (tests HealixMapper class).
# DECORATORS: @pytest.fixture, @pytest.mark.skipif.
# DEPENDENCIES: pytest, unittest.mock, logging, core.spine.healix_mapper.HealixMapper.
# INTERFACES: Pytest test discovery and execution.
# ERROR HANDLING: Uses pytest assertions.
# LOGGING: ΛTRACE_ENABLED for logging test execution.
# AUTHENTICATION: Not applicable.
# HOW TO USE:
#   Run with pytest: pytest core/advanced/brain/tests/test_healix_mapper.py
# INTEGRATION NOTES: Assumes HealixMapper can be imported correctly from core.spine.
#                    These tests rely on the mocked behavior of AccentEngine and EmotionEngine.
# MAINTENANCE: Update tests if HealixMapper API or its interaction with dependencies changes.
#              Ensure mock setups accurately reflect dependency contracts.
