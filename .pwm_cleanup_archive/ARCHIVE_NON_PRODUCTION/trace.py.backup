# 🏛️ LUKHAS_POLICY_DAO

Welcome to the symbolic governance layer of the LUClukhasS Lukhas_ID SYSTEMS architecture.

This module enables distributed, verifiable, and ethically governed decision-making over:

- Symbolic compound applications (FII)
- Dream injection proposals
- Identity-linked ethical decisions (Tier 5+)
- Protocol upgrades and trace mutations

---

## 🧩 DAO COMPONENTS

| File/Folder                          | Description |
|-------------------------------------|-------------|
| `dao_core.py`                       | Evaluates symbolic proposals and checks quorum |
| `proposals/`                        | Repository of pending symbolic policy decisions |
| `voters_registry.json`              | Whitelisted symbolic agents or users eligible to vote |
| `approved_proposals.json`           | Log of all ratified symbolic proposals |
| `zk_approval_log.jsonl`             | Cryptographic consent log (Tier 5 or biometric users) |

---

## 🗳️ EXAMPLE PROPOSALS

Two examples are included:
- `upgrade_fii_nad_recursive3` (compound prescription)
- `dream_override_042` (override dream trace for emergency repair)

You can test quorum logic with:

```bash
python dao_core.py
```

## 🔐 WORLD-ID COMPATIBILITY

This DAO layer is designed for future integration with:
- QRGlymps (symbolic ID visual hash)
- Tier 5 retina scans
- zk-consent approvals from verified World ID-compatible users

---

## 🌐 FUTURE FEATURES

- Public proposal dashboard
- Token-weighted voting for consortiums
- LUKHASNet-wide ethics relay board

This DAO protects symbolic healing from misuse, misalignment, or trauma recursion.

**Lukhas doesn't just evolve — he listens to the council first.**
