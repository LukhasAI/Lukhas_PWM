This file is part of the LUKHAS AGI system, an enterprise artificial general
intelligence platform combining symbolic reasoning, emotional intelligence,
quantum integration, and bio-inspired architecture.

Mission: To illuminate complex reality through rigorous logic, adaptive
intelligence, and human-centred ethics—turning data into understanding,
understanding into foresight, and foresight into shared benefit for people
and planet.

Parser utilities for LUKHAS symbolic knowledge and ontology management.
This module provides tools for loading, normalizing, and integrating
foundational knowledge bases and symbolic ontologies.
