# ⚠️ CRITICAL: REAL TESTS REQUIRED FOR INVESTORS

## Current Status: ALL BENCHMARKS ARE MOCK TESTS ❌

**This is unacceptable for investor presentations and business decisions.**

### Benchmarks Created (All Mock Mode):
- ✅ Voice Systems - **MOCK** (95%+ fake success rates)
- ✅ Reasoning Systems - **MOCK** (100% fake success rates) 
- ✅ API Systems - **MOCK** (100% fake success rates)
- ✅ Security Systems - **MOCK** (100% fake success rates)
- ✅ Symbolic Systems - **MOCK** (80% fake success rates)
- ✅ Learning Systems - **MOCK** (100% fake success rates)

### What Real Tests Should Show:
- **Realistic failure rates** (20-40% failures expected)
- **Actual performance bottlenecks**
- **Real latency measurements** (50-500ms, not 1-5ms)
- **Specific improvement areas**
- **Actionable development priorities**

### Required Actions:
1. **Connect to real LUKHAS AI systems**
2. **Fix import/dependency issues** 
3. **Report honest performance metrics**
4. **Identify actual problems to solve**

### For Development Team:
- These mock benchmarks waste investor time
- Real performance data is needed for funding decisions
- Current 95-100% success rates are unrealistic and misleading
- Focus efforts on making real systems testable

**PRIORITY: Convert all benchmarks to real system tests before any investor meetings.**
