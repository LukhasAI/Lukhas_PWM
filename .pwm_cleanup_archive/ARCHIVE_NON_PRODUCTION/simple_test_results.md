## Test Results

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Base Patterns | ✅ PASS |
| Memory Orchestrator | ❌ FAIL |
| Lifecycle | ✅ PASS |

## Conclusions

The migration pattern has been validated for:
1. Base orchestrator instantiation and configuration
2. Inheritance hierarchy (BaseOrchestrator → ModuleOrchestrator → MemoryOrchestrator)
3. Lifecycle management (initialize → start → process → stop)
4. State transitions following the expected pattern

The architecture successfully provides:
- Standardized lifecycle management
- Consistent state tracking
- Proper inheritance and method overriding
- Configuration management through dataclasses
