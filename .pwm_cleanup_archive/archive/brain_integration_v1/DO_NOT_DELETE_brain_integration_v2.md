# DO NOT DELETE - Brain Integration v2.0.0

## File: brain_integration_20250620_013824.py

### Status: KEEP - Contains Advanced Features

This file contains the v2.0.0 of the brain integration system with significant improvements over v1.0.0:

### Unique Features Not in v1.0.0:
1. **BrainIntegrationConfig Class**
   - Configuration management from INI files
   - Emotion adjustment factors
   - System paths configuration

2. **DynamicImporter Class**
   - Dynamic module importing system
   - Graceful handling of import failures
   - Allows modular component loading

3. **TierAccessControl Class**
   - Sophisticated tier-based access control
   - Feature availability by tier
   - Access validation system

4. **Complete Implementation**
   - All TODOs resolved
   - 1330 lines (vs 1201 in v1.0.0)
   - More robust error handling

### Why This Advances AGI:
- **Modularity**: Dynamic importing allows components to be added/removed without code changes
- **Configurability**: External configuration makes the system adaptable
- **Security**: Tier-based access control enables safe multi-user scenarios
- **Completeness**: All planned features implemented

### Integration Plan:
These features should be carefully merged into the main brain_integration.py in orchestration/brain/
rather than simply replacing it, to preserve any unique logic from both versions.
