## I. PREAMBLE: THE SYMBOLIC CONTRACT

This manifest serves as the foundational symbolic contract governing the Meta-Learning Enhancement System for LUKHAS. It establishes the principles, boundaries, and evolutionary pathways for meta-learning optimization while preserving the core symbolic reasoning capabilities that define LUKHAS intelligence.

### Core Tenets

2. **Symbolic Sovereignty** - Symbolic reasoning maintains primacy over optimization
3. **Ethical Primacy** - All learning optimizations must pass ethical compliance checks
4. **Federated Harmony** - Cross-node learning respects privacy and autonomy
5. **Quantum Accountability** - All decisions maintain cryptographic audit trails
