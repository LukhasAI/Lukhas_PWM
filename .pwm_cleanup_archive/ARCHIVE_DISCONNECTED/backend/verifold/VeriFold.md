## Overview

**CollapseHash** is a cryptographic fingerprint generated at the moment a symbolic decision, memory, or cognitive event "collapses" into a final state within a system like LUKHAS. It acts like a **timestamped signature of truth** — freezing the ethical, emotional, and intentional context of a decision.

Think of it as the **unique DNA** of a decision.

## Purpose

- 🎯 **Track and audit decisions** made by symbolic AI  
- 🔐 **Cryptographically sign cognitive events** for security and verification  
- 🧠 **Represent symbolic state** at the point of cognitive collapse  
- 🌀 **Enable trust and forensics** in memory replays, dream simulations, or ethical arbitration

## Core Concepts

| Term              | Meaning                                                                 |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Collapse**      | The point at which a symbolic decision becomes final                    |
| **Snapshot**      | The structured record of emotional, ethical, and intentional state      |
| **Hash**          | A fixed-length cryptographic digest uniquely representing the snapshot  |
| **Signature**     | A digital (post-quantum) cryptographic proof that the hash is authentic |

## How It Works

1. ✅ **Capture symbolic context** (intent vector, emotions, ethics, context note)  
2. 🧊 **Freeze it** into a deterministic snapshot  
3. 🧮 **Hash it** using BLAKE3 (fast and future-resistant)  
4. 🔏 **Digitally sign** the hash with SPHINCS+ (quantum-secure)  
5. 🧾 **Return** a verifiable package: snapshot + hash + signature + public key

## Example Output

```json
{
  "collapse_snapshot": {
    "intent": [0.5, 0.2, -0.1],
    "emotion": "calm_reflective",
    "ethics": "tier_2_approved",
    "context": "memory injection after audit",
    "timestamp": "2025-06-21T14:02:15Z"
  },
  "collapse_hash": "b837b9e1a7e...d91",
  "signature": "3045022...",
  "signing_algorithm": "SPHINCS+-SHAKE256-128f-simple",
  "public_key": "0a4d3e8..."
}
```

## Why It Matters

- **Immutable**: Once generated, the hash and signature cannot be tampered with.  
- **Ethically Verifiable**: Trusted decisions can be audited long after they were made.  
- **Post-Quantum Safe**: Resistant to current and future cryptographic threats.  
- **Symbolically Meaningful**: Embeds emotion and ethics into a verifiable ledger.

## Where to Use It

- 🎭 Dream collapse finalization (`rem_visualiser`)  
- 📚 Symbolic memory snapshots (`memoria`)  
- 🧭 Ethical arbitration chains (`ABAS`)  
- 🔎 Forensic trace logs (`SecureAGILogger`)  
- 🪞 Decision replays or reflections (`collapse_engine`)  

---

## Developer Tip

To integrate, simply call:

```python
from collapse_hash_pq import generate_signed_collapse
signed = generate_signed_collapse(your_payload_dict)
```

You can then store the output or verify it later using the included `public_key` and signature.
