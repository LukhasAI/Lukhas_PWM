Naming Conventions for LUKHAS Modules and Plugins

Naming conventions are crucial in software projects – especially in an AI ecosystem like LUKHAS – to ensure clarity, consistency, and professionalism. In this deep dive, we compare several naming styles for module/plugin names (using the example MemoryHealixMapper and its variations) and evaluate each for readability, IDE friendliness, cross-language compatibility, and alignment with industry standards. We then recommend a unified convention for the LUKHAS ecosystem and provide clear guidelines for developers.

Common Naming Styles for Modules/Plugins

The same conceptual name can be styled in different ways. Below are the prevalent conventions, using Memory Healix Mapper as the base name:
	•	PascalCase – e.g. MemoryHealixMapper
Each word is capitalized and concatenated. This is also known as UpperCamelCase. Common in class names and some frameworks.
	•	camelCase – e.g. memoryHealixMapper
First word in lowercase, subsequent words capitalized. Often used for variables or functions in languages like JavaScript/Java.
	•	snake_case – e.g. memory_healix_mapper
All words in lowercase, separated by underscores. Typical for function/variable names in Python and some configs or file names.
	•	kebab-case – e.g. memory-healix-mapper
All words in lowercase, separated by hyphens (-). Common for file names, URLs, or package names (especially in npm). Note: Not valid for identifiers in most programming languages (hyphen would be a minus sign).

Each style has distinct aesthetics. For instance, MemoryHealixMapper (PascalCase) gives a modular, symbolic feel – the capital letters hint at each sub-component (“Memory”, “Healix”, “Mapper”). In contrast, memory_healix_mapper uses an explicit separator for clarity, while memory-healix-mapper might appear in a file or config context. The memoryHealixMapper form is a midpoint – no underscores, but the lowercase first letter makes it look more like a variable than a module name.

Readability and Clarity

Human readability is paramount since code is read far more often than written ￼. Opinions differ on which style is easiest to read:
	•	PascalCase & camelCase: Rely on capital letters to delimit words. Many developers find this readable once accustomed, though very long names can be harder to parse without visual separators. Research indicates camelCase (and by extension PascalCase) can lead to higher accuracy in recognizing identifiers compared to underscores, possibly because the camelCase style forces more careful reading ￼ ￼. However, the same study noted identifiers with underscores can be read slightly faster (on average 13.5% faster to scan) than camelCase ones ￼ ￼. In summary, Camel/PascalCase may slow reading speed a bit but can reduce misidentification of characters ￼. For example, MemoryHealixMapper has no distracting characters, but you must mentally chunk “Memory” vs “Healix” vs “Mapper” by the capital letters.
	•	snake_case: Underscores explicitly separate words, which many find very readable because it mimics spaces in phrases ￼. For example, memory_healix_mapper clearly shows three words. This style is often considered self-documenting – the separators leave no doubt about word boundaries. Some argue underscores make identifiers longer and break the visual flow of text. However, studies show underscores (as a stand-in for spaces) have essentially no negative impact on comprehension speed in reading, whereas removing word separators (as in a continuous string) slows reading significantly ￼. So memory_healix_mapper is quick to scan and understand, at the cost of extra characters.
	•	kebab-case: Similar to snake_case in readability (memory-healix-mapper is as clear as underscores). It’s visually clean in documentation or config. But in code, the - character isn’t allowed in identifiers, so this style is usually seen only in filenames, URLs, or config keys. Therefore, its readability is relevant mainly outside actual code (and in those cases, it’s quite readable). One must be cautious that in certain contexts (like command-line or some tooling), hyphens might need escaping or can be misinterpreted (e.g. as a minus sign).

In practice, consistency matters more than the specific style ￼. A project that uniformly uses one convention will be easier to read overall than one with mixed styles. All the above styles are readable when used consistently; the key is to pick one that aligns with the context and stick with it.

Efficiency in IDEs and Tools

Modern IDEs and code editors offer features that can take advantage of naming conventions:
	•	Autocomplete and Intellisense: Regardless of naming style, IDEs will suggest completions after a few characters. However, PascalCase/camelCase names can be easier to complete via abbreviation. For example, in many IDEs (JetBrains, VS Code, etc.), typing the capital letters of a PascalCase name will match the identifier. Typing “MHM” might quickly find MemoryHealixMapper due to the CamelHumps feature ￼. Similarly, with snake_case, some IDEs allow matching on word initials (e.g., typing “mhm” could match memory_healix_mapper if configured). JetBrains Rider/PyCharm explicitly treat underscores and camel humps as word boundaries, so one can type the initials of each part of a name to find it ￼. This means both MemoryHealixMapper and memory_healix_mapper are efficiently searchable by acronym in good IDEs.
	•	Navigation: PascalCase and snake_case both allow quick navigation by “word”. Editors can jump between Memory → Healix → Mapper or between memory → healix → mapper using CamelHumps navigation. Double-click selection can be configured to either grab the whole identifier or just a part, depending on settings. In general, there’s no major efficiency issue with any style for modern tooling – they all support fast search and navigation if used consistently.
	•	Visual Distinction: In code, PascalCase is often used for types/classes, whereas snake_case is used for functions/variables (in languages like Python). This by itself can improve clarity in editors: seeing a name like MemoryHealixMapper might immediately signal “this is a class or significant component” due to the convention, whereas memory_healix_mapper might suggest a function or module name. This helps developers mentally distinguish usage. Many industry style guides leverage this; for example, Python uses CapWords (PascalCase) for classes and snake_case for functions/variables ￼ ￼. Similarly, Java uses PascalCase for classes and lowerCamel for methods ￼ ￼. Adhering to these norms means IDEs and static analyzers will label and display these elements in expected ways (e.g. some linters might warn if a class isn’t CapWords in Python).
	•	Typing effort: Some argue that avoiding underscores (using camelCase) is faster to type because you don’t need to reach for the underscore character ￼. In practice, the difference is minor for experienced typists (and underscores “feel” natural to many Python devs). The slight trade-off in typing speed should be weighed against readability and standards rather than being a primary factor.

Bottom line: All styles are well-supported by modern IDEs. PascalCase and snake_case both enable quick symbol lookup (thanks to acronym matching or word separation) ￼. Choose the style that fits the project’s needs; developers’ tools will accommodate it. Just ensure everyone on the team is familiar with how to search/navigate compound names in their editor (e.g. enable CamelHumps in JetBrains products).

Cross-Language Compatibility

A key consideration for LUKHAS is that its ecosystem may span multiple languages (e.g. Python for core logic, JavaScript for UI or extensions, etc.). A naming convention should be broadly compatible and not conflict with language-specific guidelines:
	•	Python: PEP 8, the de-facto Python style guide, says modules (files) should have short, all-lowercase names, with optional underscores for readability ￼. Class names should use the CapWords (PascalCase) convention ￼. Variables and functions use lowercase_with_underscores ￼. This means in Python it’s idiomatic to have a file memory_healix_mapper.py containing a class MemoryHealixMapper. Using a capitalized name for a module (filename) is discouraged, and using camelCase for functions or variables would be considered non-pythonic unless there’s a good reason ￼.
	•	JavaScript/TypeScript: There isn’t one single enforced style, but common conventions are to use camelCase for variables and functions, and PascalCase for constructor functions or classes (especially in ES6+ where classes are a language feature). File names in many JavaScript projects are lowercase (sometimes with hyphens or underscores). For example, one might have memoryHealixMapper.js or memory-healix-mapper.js as a file, exporting a class MemoryHealixMapper. Notably, Node.js/npm package names are typically lowercase with hyphens (e.g. memory-healix-mapper on npm), because package identifiers are often all-lowercase. Within code, however, a class or React component might use PascalCase and a regular function would use camelCase.
	•	Java/C#: These languages strictly prefer PascalCase for class names and camelCase for methods and fields. Java package names are all lowercase (often without underscores, using dots to separate hierarchy). C# namespaces are PascalCase. So MemoryHealixMapper as a class fits well in Java/C#. But memory_healix_mapper (with underscores) would be very unusual in those languages’ class names. If LUKHAS were to expose a Java API, you’d want to present class names in PascalCase to meet Java expectations ￼.
	•	Other contexts: Hyphenated names are generally not allowed in identifiers in the above languages. They can appear in config files, URLs, or command-line interfaces. For example, a command-line tool might use lukhas --enable-memory-healix-mapper, which is readable. But in source code, you’d never have a variable or class named with a -. Thus, kebab-case would need to be converted to another form in code (often just removing or replacing - with _ or camelCase).

Compatibility pitfalls: One must avoid naming that causes conflicts across systems:
	•	Case sensitivity: Some filesystems (Windows, macOS by default) are case-insensitive, whereas Linux is case-sensitive. A file named MemoryHealixMapper.py might be treated the same as memoryhealixmapper.py on Windows but not on Linux. Using lowercase for filenames sidesteps this. In fact, developers have reported errors when deploying code to Linux because a file was named in camelCase and referenced in a different case ￼ ￼. The safe approach is to use lowercase (with optional underscores or hyphens) for file and directory names to avoid issues ￼. For instance, a NodeJS module lib/MemoryHealixMapper.js could fail on a Linux server if referenced as require('./lib/memoryHealixMapper') with mismatched case ￼. Renaming to lib/memory_healix_mapper.js or similar is the robust solution.
	•	Hyphen in filenames: While - is fine in filenames, if those filenames are used in import statements or require calls, it can be problematic. For example, in NodeJS one cannot do require('./memory-healix-mapper') without special handling – the hyphen would need the string literal form and some tools might misinterpret it. A developer noted that using a dash in a file name required awkward access (e.g., browser.page['admin-login']() in a testing framework) and switching to underscore solved the issue ￼. In general, underscores are the safest separator for file names when multiple words are needed ￼. They won’t confuse parsers or require special quoting.
	•	Consistency across languages: If LUKHAS modules are implemented in multiple languages (say a core in Python and a UI in JS) and you want to refer to the module by the same name, PascalCase is a good candidate. For example, a module concept “MemoryHealixMapper” can be a Python class MemoryHealixMapper and similarly a JS class MemoryHealixMapper. In Python, the import might be from lukhas.memory_healix_mapper import MemoryHealixMapper (file is snake_case, class is PascalCase), whereas in JS you might do import { MemoryHealixMapper } from 'lukhas-memory-modules';. The key is the concept name remains MemoryHealixMapper in documentation and class naming, even if the file/package naming differs slightly per language.
	•	Open-source AI project conventions: High-quality AI frameworks tend to follow language norms while keeping names descriptive. For instance, TensorFlow and PyTorch use snake_case for function names (e.g., tf.reduce_mean, torch.nn.functional.relu) and PascalCase for class names (tf.keras.layers.Dense, torch.nn.Linear). Hugging Face Transformers name model classes in PascalCase (e.g., BertModel, T5ForConditionalGeneration), and their files are lowercase (often with underscores like modeling_t5.py). This adherence to standard conventions in each language makes the projects feel professional and familiar to contributors. It’s generally frowned upon to invent a totally new naming style that contradicts the language’s guidelines, as it could hinder community adoption or maintenance. The goal should be to choose a style that feels natural in each part of the ecosystem and still ties together conceptually.

Industry Standards and Professionalism

Using industry-aligned naming means following the patterns most developers expect:
	•	PascalCase is widely seen as professional for naming types, classes, modules in many languages ￼. It treats module names as proper nouns. If LUKHAS’s modules are conceptual building blocks, PascalCase names (e.g. MemoryHealixMapper, VisionGraphAnalyzer, etc.) will signal that status. It’s analogous to how Java class names or C# classes are written, and it aligns with Python’s class naming convention ￼. Many open-source projects create new compound terms or component names in PascalCase to denote a single cohesive concept (for example, OpenAIGymEnv or DeepQLearner in some contexts).
	•	snake_case is considered professional for functions, variables, and file names in environments like Python (and also in C/C++ for variables). If a LUKHAS component is more of a low-level function or a configuration key, snake_case would be appropriate. But for module/plugin names that represent an entire unit or class, snake_case might feel too low-level unless the language strongly demands it (e.g. Python module filename). As a module name shown to users or in docs, memory_healix_mapper might not stand out as a “thing” as much as MemoryHealixMapper does.
	•	camelCase (lower Camel) is standard for method names and variables in Java, JavaScript, and many other languages. However, for naming a plugin or module (which likely is a noun or a class name), starting with a lowercase letter is less common in practice. For example, one wouldn’t typically name a Java class memoryHealixMapper – that looks like a variable. Thus, using camelCase for modules could violate the expectation that a module/component is like a type or namespace (which usually uses PascalCase). It’s better to reserve camelCase for actual function or property names, not top-level module identities.
	•	kebab-case is professional in contexts like package names or command-line options. For instance, an npm package might be lukhas-memory-mapper (all lower with hyphens). Kubernetes resource names or config files often use hyphen-separated names as well. If LUKHAS has an external package or plugin distribution, a hyphenated name could be acceptable at the package level. But inside code, developers would convert that to an identifier (likely PascalCase for a class or snake_case for a module import).

In summary, a professional approach is usually to follow the principle: Use PascalCase for user-facing component names (especially if they correspond to classes/types), and use lowercase (snake or kebab) for file and package names. This mirrors many established guidelines (Python, Java, etc.) and helps avoid surprises. It also plays well with tooling like linters and documentation generators that often assume certain naming patterns.

Recommendation for the LUKHAS Ecosystem

Given the analysis, PascalCase is the most suitable style for LUKHAS’s module, plugin, and component names, with adjustments for specific contexts. This choice balances symbolic aesthetics with industry alignment:
	•	Symbolic Modular Design Fit: PascalCase (e.g. MemoryHealixMapper) treats a module name as a single compound symbol. This aligns with LUKHAS’s design philosophy of modular, self-contained components. Each component name looks like a distinct entity or class, which is likely how LUKHAS treats modules. The capitals delineate the conceptual parts (Memory/Healix/Mapper) in a clean way without external separators, giving a brand-like feel to each module. This is useful in documentation and discussion – developers can immediately recognize XModuleName as a specific module.
	•	Cross-Language Consistency: Using PascalCase for module names allows the same name to be used in different languages with minimal changes. In Python, the class can be MemoryHealixMapper (conforming to PEP8 for classes ￼), and the module’s file can be named memory_healix_mapper.py (PEP8-compliant for files ￼). In JavaScript, the class or exported object can also be MemoryHealixMapper. In documentation or config (if needed), the module could be referred to as “MemoryHealixMapper” as well. This consistency avoids confusion – a developer reading LUKHAS docs sees one name per module, not different styles in different places. It also aligns with other ecosystems where a conceptual component retains a PascalCase name across boundaries (for example, a React component might be referred to by its PascalCase name even if the file is lowercased).
	•	IDE and tooling: By adopting PascalCase for the core names (and snake_case for file names), LUKHAS gets the best of both. Developers can search by the PascalCase name’s initials in their IDE to find references quickly ￼. The visual cue of a capitalized name tells Python developers “this is likely a class or major component,” which is appropriate for a module/plugin. Meanwhile, using all-lowercase file or package names ensures there are no deployment issues on different OSes ￼. Linters and style checkers can be configured accordingly (e.g., Python’s flake8 with pep8-naming plugin can enforce that classes are CapWords and module names are lowercase ￼).
	•	Professional Standardization: This approach closely follows widely-used conventions, lending credibility to LUKHAS. It shows that the project respects language norms (important for open-source contributors). For example, a new developer will find the naming familiar: classes in LUKHAS look like classes elsewhere, modules are named like typical Python modules, etc. This lowers the learning curve and prevents style debates.

Guidelines for LUKHAS Developers

To implement this recommendation, we outline concrete naming rules for all LUKHAS modules, plugins, and extensions:
	1.	Use PascalCase for Module & Plugin Names: Name each module/plugin as a capitalized compound word. For example, use MemoryHealixMapper instead of memory_healix_mapper or memoryHealixMapper for the official component name. Each significant word in the name should start with a capital letter, with no separators. This will typically correspond to the class name of the module in code. ￼ ￼
	2.	Use Meaningful Words: Ensure each part of the PascalCase name is clear and descriptive. Avoid abbreviations unless they are well-known acronyms. (For instance, prefer AudioSignalProcessor over AudSigProc). This makes the purpose of the module immediately evident. Java naming guidelines advise using whole words and avoiding obscure acronyms in class names ￼ – the same applies here.
	3.	File and Directory Naming: When naming files or folders for modules, use lowercase names. Use underscores (_) if necessary to improve readability (e.g. a file could be memory_healix_mapper.py). Do not use capital letters or spaces in file names. This avoids issues on case-insensitive file systems and makes package imports consistent ￼ ￼. For example: a module class MemoryHealixMapper might reside in a file memory_healix_mapper.py (Python) or memory-healix-mapper.js (if a JS package, though inside the code it’s imported without the hyphen). The key is external identifiers (files, package names) are lowercase to prevent deployment headaches ￼.
	4.	Consistency Across Languages: Maintain the PascalCase naming for the component in each language’s code, but adapt to language-specific file/package conventions. For instance:
	•	Python: Define the class MemoryHealixMapper in memory_healix_mapper.py. Other Python code should import and refer to the class by the PascalCase name. Module registry keys (if any) can also use "MemoryHealixMapper" as the identifier to match the class.
	•	JavaScript: If using ES modules or classes, define class MemoryHealixMapper { ... } and export it. The file might be named memoryHealixMapper.js or memory_healix_mapper.js depending on team preference, but ensure consistency (many JS projects use lowercase file names). When publishing on npm, use a lowercase name (e.g. "lukhas-memory-mapper" package) to follow npm norms, but document the module’s class name as MemoryHealixMapper.
	•	Other Languages: Follow similar patterns – e.g., Java class MemoryHealixMapper in package lukhas.memory (all lower for package name), C# class MemoryHealixMapper in namespace Lukhas.Modules (PascalCase allowed in C# namespace segments). The idea is to always present the module’s intent name in PascalCase in code, while peripheral naming obeys that ecosystem’s rules.
	5.	Use camelCase or snake_case for Internals: Inside each module’s implementation, use conventional naming for internal functions, methods, and variables. For example, a method inside MemoryHealixMapper class should likely be def process_memory() in Python (snake_case) or processMemory() in JavaScript (camelCase), depending on language. Reserve PascalCase strictly for module/class names and perhaps global constants. This ensures internal code remains idiomatic to the language and only the module naming at the top level carries the PascalCase style.
	6.	Avoid Hyphens in Code Identifiers: Do not use - in any identifier that will be used in source code (class, function, variable names). Hyphens can’t be used in Python or most language identifiers, and even in file names they can cause import difficulties ￼. Stick to PascalCase (preferred) or underscores if needed (for file names or config keys). If a plugin system requires a human-readable name that might be displayed, you can always format the PascalCase name with spaces or hyphens for display, but not in code. For example, MemoryHealixMapper could be shown in a UI as “Memory Healix Mapper” for clarity – but in code and configuration, it stays MemoryHealixMapper (or memory_healix_mapper in a config file if all config keys are lowercase).
	7.	Enforce with Linters/Reviews: Treat these conventions as part of the coding standard. Use linters or CI checks where possible. For Python, consider using pep8-naming (a flake8 plugin) which can check that classes are PascalCase and functions are snake_case, etc. ￼. In code reviews, ensure new modules or plugins follow the naming scheme. Consistency is critical: as PEP 8 notes, consistency within a project is more important than strictly following one style guide rule ￼. So, all LUKHAS contributors should adhere to this standard to keep the ecosystem uniform.
	8.	Document the Convention: Add a section in LUKHAS’s developer documentation about naming. Provide examples of correct naming vs incorrect. E.g., “Correct: KnowledgeFusionEngine (module class name), in file knowledge_fusion_engine.py. Incorrect: knowledgeFusionEngine (not capitalized), or KnowledgeFusion-Engine (contains hyphen).” By being explicit, new developers won’t have to guess the intended style.
	9.	Refactor Legacy Names if Needed: If some existing modules/plugins in LUKHAS use a different convention (say some are CamelCase and others snake_case), consider renaming them to fit the new standard. This might involve renaming classes, updating references, and possibly providing aliases or backward-compatibility shims if it’s a public API. The effort will pay off by eliminating confusion. However, as always, balance this with practicality – if an older naming cannot be changed easily, at least ensure all new development follows the convention (and perhaps mark the old style as deprecated).
	10.	Example Reference: To illustrate the standard, here’s how a LUKHAS module might be structured following these guidelines:
Python example (module and class):
File: memory_healix_mapper.py

# Module: memory_healix_mapper.py

class MemoryHealixMapper:
    \"\"\"Documentation for the MemoryHealixMapper module.\"\"\"
    def __init__(self, config):
        # initialization
        ...
    def buildMemoryIndex(self, data):
        # Method in snake_case would be prefered in Python, but let's say this is a special case.
        ...
    def reset_memory(self):
        # using snake_case for regular methods
        ...

# Usage elsewhere in Python code:
from lukhas.modules.memory_healix_mapper import MemoryHealixMapper
mapper = MemoryHealixMapper(config)
mapper.reset_memory()

Rationale: The class is MemoryHealixMapper (PascalCase). The file name is all lowercase with underscores. Methods inside generally use snake_case (reset_memory). If a method name conceptually mirrors a class name or design pattern, you might occasionally see CamelCase (e.g. buildMemoryIndex above), but PEP8 would actually suggest build_memory_index – so prefer underscores for method names in Python. The key point is the module’s external name is PascalCase.
JavaScript example (module and usage):
File: MemoryHealixMapper.js (or memory-healix-mapper.js depending on project convention for filenames)

// Module: MemoryHealixMapper.js
class MemoryHealixMapper {
  constructor(config) {
    // ...
  }
  buildMemoryIndex(data) {
    // method in camelCase (JavaScript standard)
  }
  resetMemory() {
    // another method in camelCase
  }
}
export default MemoryHealixMapper;

// Usage in another part of the JS code:
import MemoryHealixMapper from './MemoryHealixMapper';
const mapper = new MemoryHealixMapper(config);
mapper.resetMemory();

Rationale: The class and exported symbol use PascalCase. Methods inside follow JavaScript’s camelCase norm. The file name here is in PascalCase to match the class (some JS projects do this for one class per file), but it could be lowercase – if the project uses lowercase file names, you’d do memoryHealixMapper.js or memory-healix-mapper.js and adjust the import. In either case, the developer-facing module name remains MemoryHealixMapper.

By following these guidelines, LUKHAS can achieve a coherent naming scheme that is readable, IDE-friendly, and consistent with industry practices. Adopting PascalCase for module/plugin names accentuates the modular design by treating each plugin as a distinct, named entity. At the same time, adhering to lowercase for files and following language-specific naming for internals ensures there’s no friction when developing or integrating across different environments.

Conclusion

PascalCase emerges as the optimal convention for naming LUKHAS modules and plugins, providing a professional and clear way to present each component. It balances the “symbolic aesthetic” (e.g. MemoryHealixMapper looks like a singular concept) with practicality (used for classes in many languages). When combined with language-specific best practices – like lowercase_snake_case for Python files and methods, or camelCase for JavaScript functions – it creates a uniform yet idiomatic codebase.

In high-quality AI projects and open-source platforms, the key is consistency and clarity. LUKHAS should enforce a consistent naming standard across all modules, plugins, and extensions ￼. This means every developer can quickly understand a name’s role (module vs function) by its style, and navigate the code with ease. Adhering to these conventions will make the LUKHAS ecosystem more accessible to new contributors and easier to maintain in the long run.
