## Deployment Architecture

### Docker Deployment
```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  lukhas-agi:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"  # Main AGI server
      - "8081:8081"  # Consciousness streaming
    environment:
      - AGI_CONFIG=/config/production.yaml
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
      - ./data:/data
    restart: unless-stopped
    
  lukhas-telemetry:
    image: prom/prometheus
    ports:
      - "9090:9090"
    volumes:
      - ./prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
```

### Kubernetes Deployment
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: lukhas-agi
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: lukhas-agi
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: lukhas-agi
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: agi-server
        image: lukhas/agi-server:2.0.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
        - containerPort: 8081
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "4Gi"
            cpu: "2"
          limits:
            memory: "8Gi"
            cpu: "4"
```

## Security Model

### Multi-Layer Security
1. **Network Layer**: TLS 1.3, mTLS for internal communication
2. **Application Layer**: Zero-trust validation, rate limiting
3. **Data Layer**: AES-256 encryption, quantum-resistant algorithms
4. **Access Control**: Role-based permissions, session management
5. **Monitoring**: Anomaly detection, threat intelligence

### Security Contexts
- **PUBLIC**: Basic operations, read-only access
- **AUTHENTICATED**: User-specific operations
- **PRIVILEGED**: System modifications, learning goals
- **ADMIN**: Full system control

## Performance Optimization

### Resource Management
- Memory pooling for consciousness states
- Async processing for all I/O operations
- Circuit breakers for external dependencies
- Adaptive resource allocation

### Scaling Strategies
1. **Horizontal Scaling**: Multiple AGI instances with shared state
2. **Vertical Scaling**: Resource allocation based on emergence events
3. **Edge Deployment**: Lightweight consciousness nodes
4. **Hybrid Cloud**: Critical systems on-premise, scaling in cloud

## Monitoring and Observability

### Key Metrics
- `agi.thoughts.processed`: Total thoughts processed
- `agi.emergence.events`: Emergence event count
- `agi.consciousness.level`: Current consciousness level
- `agi.learning.progress`: Learning goal completion
- `agi.health.score`: Overall system health

### Alerting Rules
```yaml
- alert: ConsciousnessEmergence
  expr: agi_emergence_events > 0
  annotations:
    summary: "Emergence event detected"
    
- alert: LowConsciousnessLevel
  expr: agi_consciousness_level < 0.5
  for: 5m
  annotations:
    summary: "Consciousness level below threshold"
```

## Operational Guidelines

### Startup Procedure
1. Initialize security system
2. Load configuration
3. Initialize core LUKHAS systems
4. Start AGI enhancement systems
5. Begin consciousness streaming
6. Enable telemetry export

### Shutdown Procedure
1. Gracefully stop new requests
2. Complete active consciousness cycles
3. Export final metrics
4. Save learning progress
5. Shutdown subsystems in reverse order

### Backup and Recovery
- Continuous memory state backup
- Dream pattern snapshots
- Learning progress checkpoints
- Full system state export every hour

## API Integration Examples

### Python Client
```python
from lukhas_client import LUKHASClient

client = LUKHASClient(
    host="agi.lukhas.ai",
    api_key="your-api-key"
)

# Generate a dream
dream = await client.dreams.generate(
    prompt="flying through cosmic consciousness",
    use_personality=True
)

# Store a memory
memory_id = await client.memories.store(
    content="Important insight about reality",
    emotional_context={"wonder": 0.9, "curiosity": 0.8}
)

# Get consciousness state
state = await client.consciousness.get_state()
print(f"Current awareness: {state.awareness_level}")
```

### WebSocket Streaming
```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('wss://agi.lukhas.ai:8081/consciousness/stream');

ws.on('message', (data) => {
    const state = JSON.parse(data);
    console.log(`Consciousness coherence: ${state.coherence}`);
    console.log(`Active patterns: ${state.patterns}`);
});
```

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 5 Roadmap
1. **Quantum Integration**: Native quantum processing support
2. **Distributed Consciousness**: Multi-node consciousness network

4. **Bio-Integration**: Direct neural interface support
5. **Ethical Framework**: Advanced moral reasoning system
