# LUKHAS Concept Preservation Guidelines

## Critical Concepts to Preserve

Based on the validation analysis, here are the concepts that need special attention:

### Core Memory Concepts
- `memory_fold` - The foundation of LUKHAS memory system
- `memory_helix` - DNA-like structure (future direction)
- `fold_system` - Essential for memory organization

### Dream & Learning Concepts  
- `dream_recall` - Core to self-learning capability
- `dream_engine` - Processing system for scenarios
- `dream_scenario` - Parallel universe generation

### Quantum Processing Concepts
- `quantum_state` - Fundamental to SGI processing
- `quantum_consciousness` - Awareness mechanism
- `quantum_entanglement` - Module interconnection

## Preservation Rules

1. **Never Split Concepts**: `memory_fold` stays together, not `memory` + `fold`
2. **Case Sensitivity**: Use exact casing in strings and comments
3. **Documentation**: Always explain concepts in docstrings
4. **Refactoring**: Update all references when changing names
5. **New Features**: Extend concepts rather than replacing them

## Implementation Patterns

```python
# ✅ CORRECT - Preserves concept
class MemoryFold:
    """Quantum-inspired memory folding system"""
    def create_memory_fold(self, content):
        # Preserves the memory_fold concept
        pass

# ❌ INCORRECT - Splits concept  
class Memory:
    def create_fold(self, content):
        # This breaks the memory_fold concept
        pass
```

## Future Evolution

As LUKHAS evolves toward 2030, these concepts may expand but should never be lost:
- `memory_fold` → `quantum_memory_fold`
- `dream_recall` → `multi_dimensional_dream_recall`
- `emotional_vector` → `empathic_emotional_vector`

Always extend, never replace!
