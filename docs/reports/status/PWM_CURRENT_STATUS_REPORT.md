## 🎯 STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### **🟢 KEEP (Cherry-Picked Critical Files)**
**Recommendation: Keep all 4 meaningful isolated files**

1. **`meta/HEADER_FOOTER_STANDARD.py`** - 11.7KB template system
2. **`foundry/__init__.py`** - 4.5KB module interface  
3. **`meta/HEADER_TEMPLATE.py`** - 0.9KB template utilities
4. **`embodiment/body_state.py`** - 0.5KB robotics interface

### **🔴 ARCHIVE (Minimal Cleanup Needed)**
**Recommendation: Archive only 3 empty files**

1. **`testing/__init__.py`** - Empty file (0KB)
2. **`lukhas-id/mobile/__init__.py`** - Empty file (0KB)  
3. **`lukhas-id/mobile/qr_code_animator.py`** - Empty file (0KB)
