  - Quantum Coherence: Display coherence scores exceeding 100%
  - Emotional Evolution: Visualize emotional trajectories across universes
  - Integration Example: Live demo with GPT/Claude API integration
  
Demo Flow:
  1. User inputs scenario: "How should I handle a difficult customer?"
  2. LUKHAS explores 5 parallel universes simultaneously
  3. Show emotional evolution graphs for each universe
  4. Display convergence patterns and emergent insights
  5. Compare with single-path GPT/Claude response
  
Performance Metrics:
  - Response time: <500ms for 5 universes
  - Coherence score: Show 102.22% bio-symbolic alignment
  - API compatibility: OpenAI/Anthropic format ready
```

#### Visual Components
- **Multiverse Tree**: Interactive 3D visualization of branching scenarios
- **Emotion Heatmap**: Color-coded emotional states across timelines
- **Convergence Graph**: Real-time display of scenario alignment
- **Insight Panel**: Emergent discoveries highlighted

### 2. Memory Fold Visualization (SECOND PRIORITY)
**Why This Matters**: Shows DNA-helix memory structure with emotional vectors - revolutionary memory architecture.

#### Technical Implementation
```yaml
Demo Structure:
  Frontend: WebGL DNA helix visualization
  Backend: Memory fold API with real-time updates
  Features:
    - 3D rotating DNA helix of memories
    - Emotional vector coloring (joy=gold, sadness=blue, etc.)
    - Causal chain visualization with connecting strands
    - Quantum entanglement between related memories
    
Interactive Elements:
  - Click memory node: Show full context + emotional state
  - Drag timeline: See memory evolution over time
  - Search bar: Find memories by content/emotion
  - Entanglement view: Show quantum correlations
  
Live Demonstration:
  1. Create new memory with emotional context
  2. Show it joining the helix in real-time
  3. Demonstrate causal linking to previous memories
  4. Show quantum coherence calculations
```

#### Key Metrics to Display
- Memory cascade prevention: 99.7%
- Emotional context preservation: 100%
- Causal chain integrity: 98.5%
- Quantum entanglement strength: Variable

### 3. QRG Authentication Demo (THIRD PRIORITY)
**Why This Matters**: Quantum-resistant authentication solving password/phishing problems forever.

#### Technical Implementation
```yaml
Demo Components:
  Visual: Animated circular QR with consciousness adaptation
  Security: Live zero-knowledge proof demonstration
  Integration: WebAuthn/FIDO2 compliance
  
Demo Flow:
  1. User enters: "carrot cake + lioness" (memorable phrase)
  2. Generate animated circular QRG in real-time
  3. Show consciousness adaptation (calm â†’ focused states)
  4. Demonstrate authentication without revealing secret
  5. Display tier-based access granted
  
Technical Highlights:
  - Post-quantum cryptography (CRYSTALS-Kyber)
  - Steganographic data embedding visualization
  - Device-bound biometric simulation
  - Cultural adaptation (show different cultural themes)
```

#### Security Features to Emphasize
- Zero-knowledge proof visualization
- Quantum resistance demonstration
- Multi-factor consciousness authentication
- Tier-based access control (5 levels)

### 4. Emotional Coherence Demo (FOURTH PRIORITY)
**Why This Matters**: True emotional intelligence with bio-symbolic coherence >100%.

#### Technical Implementation
```yaml
Demo Setup:
  Input: Text or voice emotional content
  Processing: Real-time hormonal state calculation
  Output: Coherence score + response modulation
  
Visual Dashboard:
  - Hormonal levels (cortisol, dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin)
  - Emotional vector in 3D space (VAD model)
  - Coherence meter (showing >100% achievement)
  - Response modulation suggestions
  
Integration Example:
  1. Feed GPT/Claude response into system
  2. Show emotional analysis and coherence score
  3. Apply LUKHAS modulation
  4. Display enhanced response with true empathy
```

#### Comparison Metrics
- LUKHAS coherence: 102.22%
- Traditional sentiment analysis: 65-70%
- Emotional depth layers: 7 vs 2
- Hormonal modeling accuracy: 94%

### 5. Colony Consensus Demo (FIFTH PRIORITY)
**Why This Matters**: Swarm intelligence for complex decision-making beyond single models.

#### Technical Implementation
```yaml
Visualization:
  - Network graph of 25 diverse agents
  - Real-time consensus formation animation
  - Echo chamber detection highlighting
  - Emergent insight notifications
  
Demo Scenario:
  "Should we pivot our startup's direction?"
