# 🧠 LUKHAS Lean Working Components

**Essential LUKHAS AGI Components - Distilled and Functional**

This repository contains the core, working components of the LUKHAS AGI system, distilled using Pack-What-Matters methodology to include only what's essential and functional.

## 🎯 Repository Purpose

> "Pack what matters: Keep only the components that work and are essential to LUKHAS functionality."

This lean version focuses on:
- **🔧 Working Components** - Only proven, functional LUKHAS modules
- **🧠 Core Systems** - Essential consciousness, memory, and identity systems
- **⚡ Active Integration** - Components that are currently integrated and operational
- **🎯 Minimal Dependencies** - Stripped of experimental or incomplete features
- **📊 Real Functionality** - Systems that deliver actual LUKHAS capabilities

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install core dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure LUKHAS components
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your LUKHAS settings

# Run core systems
python main.py
```

## 🛡️ Guardian System Integration

Your lean LUKHAS workspace is now protected by the **Guardian System v1.0.0** - a production-grade ethical governance system that ensures operational integrity.

### 🚀 What's Protected

- **Critical Components**: Core LUKHAS modules and configurations
- **System Integrity**: Prevents accidental corruption of working systems
- **Operational Health**: Monitors and maintains lean component functionality
- **Ethical Oversight**: Multi-layer validation for system operations

### 🧪 Quick Test

```bash
# Test governance system
python test_governance.py

# Run comprehensive tests
python test_comprehensive_governance.py
```
