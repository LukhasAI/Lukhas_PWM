# Module Audit: Jules 05 - Emotion Audit & Affect Loops

**Agent:** Jules 05
**Date:** 2024-07-15
**Scope:** Audit symbolic affect storage and retrieval, confirm feedback loop tagging, connect recurring affect patterns with DriftScore evolution, and build bridge logic for dream-emotion replay triggers.

## Summary of Findings

- **Symbolic Affect Storage and Retrieval:** Affect is stored in the `EmotionalMemory` class in `memory/core_memory/emotional_memory.py` and retrieved through its methods. Feedback is handled by two different systems, a simple logger in `core/interfaces/lukhas_as_agent/sys/nias/feedback_loop.py` and a more advanced `SymbolicFeedbackSystem` in `learning/meta_learning/symbolic_feedback.py`.
- **Feedback Loop Tagging:** No files were found with the tags `ΛTAG: emotion`, `ΛTAG: feedback`, or `ΛTAG: recall`. This indicates a lack of consistent tagging in the codebase.
- **Recurring Affect Patterns and DriftScore Evolution:** The `SymbolicDriftTracker` is a stub, so there is no `DriftScore` evolution.
- **Dream-Emotion Replay Triggers:** A new file `creativity/dream_systems/dream_emotion_bridge.py` has been created to provide bridge logic for dream-emotion replay triggers.

## Changes Made

1.  **Created `creativity/dream_systems/dream_emotion_bridge.py`:**
    - This file provides a `DreamEmotionBridge` class that can be used to trigger dream replays based on emotional state.

## Recommendations

- **Connect Recurring Affect Patterns with DriftScore Evolution:** The `SymbolicDriftTracker` should be improved to calculate a `DriftScore` and the recurring affect patterns should be connected to this score.
- **Consistent Tagging:** The codebase should be updated to use consistent tags for all emotion-related modules. This will make it easier to audit and maintain the code in the future.
- **Integrate `DreamEmotionBridge`:** The `DreamEmotionBridge` should be integrated into the main application logic to trigger dream replays.
