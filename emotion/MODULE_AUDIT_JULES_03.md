# Module Audit - Jules 03

This document summarizes the audit and refinement of the intent processing pipeline.

## Files Audited

- `orchestration/orchestrator.py`
- `nodes/intent_node.py`

## Changes Made

- **Refined Signal Path:** Added more detailed logging to the `IntentNode` class to make it easier to trace the flow of information through the pipeline.
- **Extended `collapse_hash` Metrics:** Extended the `collapse_hash` metrics to include intent states.
- **Added New Drift Types:** Added `intent_conflict` and `intent_absent` to the list of supported drift types in the `SymbolicDriftTracker` class.
- **Wrote Symbolic Fallback Logic:** Added a symbolic fallback logic to the `IntentNode` class to handle cases where the intent processing fails.

## Stretch Goals

- **Wrap `intent/result` in Fallback State:** The `process` method in `IntentNode` now has a fallback mechanism that returns a default intent if the intent processing fails. This addresses the stretch goal of wrapping `intent/result` in a symbolic fallback state.
