# Learning Layer

## ✅ Purpose
The Learning layer implements all machine learning, reinforcement learning, and adaptive algorithms. It provides learning capabilities to agents and manages model training, evaluation, and deployment.

## ✅ What it can depend on
- `core/`: Base utilities and interfaces
- `memory/`: For storing and retrieving learning experiences
- `identity/`: For access control and audit logging
- External ML libraries (torch, tensorflow, scikit-learn)

## ❌ What must never import from it
- `core/`: Core is foundational and must not depend on learning
- `memory/`: Memory is a lower-level service
- Any module that learning depends on (to avoid circular dependencies)

## 🔄 Lifecycle events / triggers
- **Model Training**: Triggered by new data or scheduled training cycles
- **Prediction**: Real-time inference requests from agents
- **Evaluation**: Performance assessment and metric collection
- **Model Updates**: Hot-swapping models without system restart
- **Checkpoint**: Periodic model state persistence

## 🏗️ Key Components
- `learning_gateway.py`: Abstract interface for all learning operations
- `service.py`: Main learning service implementation
- `models/`: Trained models and architectures
- `algorithms/`: Learning algorithm implementations
- `evaluation/`: Model evaluation and metrics
- `data/`: Data loaders and preprocessing

## 🎯 Design Principles
1. **Algorithm Agnostic**: Support multiple learning paradigms (RL, supervised, unsupervised)
2. **Hot Swappable**: Models can be updated without system restart
3. **Audit Trail**: All learning operations must be logged for compliance
4. **Resource Aware**: Monitor and limit computational resources
5. **Failure Graceful**: Learning failures should not crash the system

## 🔁 Cross-layer Interactions
- Uses `memory` for experience replay and knowledge storage
- Uses `identity` for access control and audit logging
- Provides services to `orchestration` and `consciousness` layers
- Never directly accessed by `core` (only through abstractions)
