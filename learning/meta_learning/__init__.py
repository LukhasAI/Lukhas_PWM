# MODULE: learning.meta_learning
# DESCRIPTION: Initializes the meta_learning sub-package. This package likely
#              contains modules related to meta-learning algorithms, adaptive
#              strategy selection, and other high-level learning control systems.

"""LUKHAS meta_learning sub-package.""" # Changed original comment slightly for clarity
# ΛNOTE: This __init__.py file marks the directory as a Python package.
# It can be used to control the package's public API by specifying `__all__`,
# or to execute package-level initialization code. Currently, it's minimal.
# This package seems to focus on components like federated integration, monitoring,
# rate modulation, remediation, and symbolic feedback for meta-learning processes.

# Example: from .monitor_dashboard import MetaLearningMonitorDashboard
# (Uncomment and adjust if specific imports are desired at package level)

# INTEGRATION NOTES: Standard Python package initialization. Consider using `__all__`
#                    to define the public API of this package if needed.
# MAINTENANCE: Update if specific symbols need to be exported from the package directly
#              or if package-level initialization code is required.
