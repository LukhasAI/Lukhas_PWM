╠══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
║ Module: exponential_learning.py
║ Path: lukhas/learning/exponential_learning.py
║ Version: 1.0.0 | Created: 2025-01-15 | Modified: 2025-07-25
║ Authors: LUKHAS AI Learning Team | Jules-04 Agent
╠══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
║ DESCRIPTION
╠══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
║ This module implements LUKHAS's exponential learning system, a revolutionary
║ approach to AI knowledge acquisition that accelerates learning effectiveness
║ over time. Unlike traditional learning systems with diminishing returns, this
║ architecture leverages compound growth patterns inspired by neural plasticity
║ and memetic evolution.
║
║ KEY FEATURES:
║ • Exponential Growth Factor: Learning effectiveness increases exponentially
║   with each adaptation cycle, modeling accelerated intelligence emergence
║ • Dynamic Pattern Extraction: Advanced pattern recognition that evolves to
║   identify increasingly subtle relationships in experience data
║ • Weighted Knowledge Updates: Temporal weighting system that balances recent
║   insights with established knowledge using exponential decay functions
║ • Periodic Consolidation: Automatic knowledge base optimization to prevent
║   information entropy and maintain coherence at scale
║ • Self-Improving Architecture: The learning system learns how to learn better,
║   implementing meta-learning principles autonomously
║
║ THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS:
║ • Hebbian Learning Theory: "Neurons that fire together wire together" - the
║   system strengthens connections between frequently co-occurring patterns
║ • Power Law of Practice: Learning curves follow power law distributions,
║   with this system optimizing the exponent through self-modification
║ • Information Theory: Shannon entropy minimization during consolidation
║   phases ensures optimal knowledge compression
║ • Catastrophic Forgetting Prevention: Elastic weight consolidation inspired
║   by continual learning research (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017)
║
║ ARCHITECTURE:
║ • Knowledge Base: Hierarchical graph structure storing patterns with
║   probabilistic weights and causal relationships
║ • Learning Rate Controller: Adaptive mechanism that adjusts learning speed
║   based on confidence metrics and novelty detection
║ • Pattern Extractor: Multi-scale feature detection using symbolic and
║   subsymbolic representations
║ • Consolidation Engine: Background process that merges similar patterns
║   and prunes low-value knowledge edges
║
║ PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS:
║ • Initial Learning Rate: 0.01 (conservative baseline)
║ • Growth Factor: 1.05 (5% compound improvement per cycle)
║ • Consolidation Frequency: Every 100 adaptation cycles
║ • Memory Complexity: O(n log n) where n is pattern count
║ • Time Complexity: O(1) for updates, O(n) for consolidation
║
║ INTEGRATION NOTES:
║ • Designed to work with LUKHAS's dream systems for offline consolidation
║ • Compatible with federated learning for distributed knowledge acquisition
║ • Interfaces with consciousness module for meta-cognitive oversight
║ • Supports quantum-ready encryption for future-proof knowledge storage
║
║ Symbolic Tags: {ΛEXPONENTIAL}, {ΛMETA-LEARNING}, {ΛCOMPOUND-GROWTH}
