## 1. Introduction

This document provides a high-level overview of the symbolic roles of the key modules within the LUKHAS learning subsystem. The learning modules are responsible for the AGI's ability to adapt, improve, and acquire new knowledge and skills over time.

## 2. Module Descriptions

| Module/File | Symbolic Role & Purpose | Key Interactions & Junctions | Relevant Tags |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`meta_learning.py`** | The `MetaLearningSystem` acts as a **strategic learning orchestrator**. It selects and plans learning approaches based on context, and incorporates feedback to improve its strategies over time. It represents the AGI's ability to "learn how to learn" at a high level. | Interacts with a conceptual federated model store and a symbolic knowledge database. It's a major hub for `#ΛDREAM_LOOP` and `#ΛSEED` tags. | `#ΛDREAM_LOOP`, `#ΛSEED`, `#ΛDRIFT_POINT`, `#ΛEXPOSE` |
| **`adaptive_meta_learning.py`** | The `AdaptiveMetaLearningSystem` is a more advanced, **self-tuning meta-learning engine**. It not only selects learning strategies but also adapts its own meta-parameters (like exploration rate and adaptation rate) based on performance history. It embodies the principle of continuous self-improvement. | This module is highly self-contained but its outputs (learning results and reports) are intended to be consumed by other parts of the AGI. It makes extensive use of internal feedback loops. | `#ΛDREAM_LOOP`, `#ΛSEED`, `#ΛDRIFT_POINT`, `#ΛEXPOSE` |
| **`federated_learning.py` / `federated_integration.py`** | These modules (and related stubs) represent the AGI's ability to **learn from distributed data sources** without centralizing the data. This is crucial for privacy and scalability. | These modules interact with the `MetaLearningSystem` by providing updated models and receiving new ones. They are a primary source of potential drift. | `#ΛDRIFT_POINT`, `#ΛCOLLAPSE_POINT` (at the aggregation step) |
| **`symbolic_feedback.py`** | This conceptual module is responsible for **translating raw feedback into a symbolic format** that the meta-learning systems can understand and use. It acts as a bridge between the AGI's experiences and its learning mechanisms. | It would interact with memory systems (to get experience data) and the meta-learning systems (to provide feedback). | `#ΛREASON_REF` (output), `#ΛMEMORY_REF` (input) |
| **`tutor_learning_engine.py`** | This module appears to be a **reinforcement learning engine**. It learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties. It's a more direct, task-oriented form of learning. | Interacts with an "environment" (which could be another part of the AGI or the external world) and a reward function. | `#ΛDREAM_LOOP` (the RL loop), `#AIDENTITY_BRIDGE` (for the learner) |
