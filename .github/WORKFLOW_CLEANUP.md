# ðŸš« WORKFLOW CLEANUP: Disabling duplicate security workflows

This commit ensures only the Î›Bot Orchestrator workflow is active.
All previous individual bot workflows have been consolidated.

## DEPRECATED WORKFLOWS (now handled by orchestrator):
- ABot Advanced Security Monitor
- AGI Intelligent Security Monitor  
- agi-merge-optimizer.yml
- autonomous-security-merge.yml
- lambda-bot-automation.yml
- lambda-bot-security.yml
- abot-security.yml
- agi-intelligent-security.yml

## ACTIVE WORKFLOW:
- lambda-bot-orchestrator.yml (handles all operations)

This should stop the duplicate workflow runs you're seeing.
