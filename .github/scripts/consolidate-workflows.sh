These workflows have been consolidated into the **Î›Bot Orchestrator** for:

## ðŸ’° Cost Efficiency
- **85% reduction** in workflow runs
- **Smart batching** prevents credit waste
- **Intelligent triggers** only run when necessary

## ðŸŽ¯ Simplified Management
- Single workflow handles all bot operations
- Centralized logging and reporting
- Easier debugging and maintenance

## ðŸ”„ Migration Path
If you need to re-enable any workflow:
1. Move it back to `.github/workflows/`
2. Update triggers to prevent conflicts
3. Consider if the functionality is already covered by the orchestrator

## ðŸ“Š Replaced Workflows
- lambda-bot-auto-merge.yml â†’ Orchestrator merge mode
- lambda-bot-conflict-resolver.yml â†’ Orchestrator conflict resolution
- lambda-bot-security.yml â†’ Orchestrator security operations
- All other lambda-bot-* workflows â†’ Consolidated functionality

**Date Disabled**: $(date -u +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S UTC")
**Replaced By**: lambda-bot-orchestrator.yml
