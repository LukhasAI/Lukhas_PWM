# Dream Module Symbolic Audit (Jules-04)

**ΛAUDIT_AGENT:** Jules-04
**ΛTASK_ID:** Dream Module Symbolic Audit
**ΛSCOPE:** `memory/core_memory/dream_memory_manager.py`, `quantum/quantum_dream_adapter.py`, `core/api/dream_api.py`
**ΛCOMMIT_WINDOW:** post-safety-guards

## 1. Introduction

This document provides an audit of the LUKHAS dream module, focusing on symbolic signal routing, semantic fallbacks, recursive loop tagging, and dream output integrity.

## 2. Findings

### 2.1. `SignalType.DREAM_INVOKE` Signal Routing

The `SignalType.DREAM_INVOKE` signal was not found in the codebase. Dream generation is currently triggered by a direct call to the `generate_symbolic_dreams` function in `core/api/dream_api.py`. This function is imported from `prot2.CORE.symbolic_ai.modules.dream_generator`, which does not exist in the repository.

**Recommendation:** A dedicated `SignalType.DREAM_INVOKE` signal should be created and routed through the orchestration layer to trigger dream generation. This will provide a more robust and scalable mechanism for dream generation.

### 2.2. Semantic Fallbacks for Dream Generation Failure

The `core/api/dream_api.py` file includes a fallback mechanism in case the `generate_symbolic_dreams` function cannot be imported. This fallback mechanism has been improved to load a fallback dream from `dream/dream_fallback.json`.

### 2.3. Recursive Loop Tagging

The following recursive loops were identified and tagged:

*   `memory/core_memory/dream_memory_manager.py`: The `process_dream_cycle` method was tagged with `#ΛDREAM_LOOP`.
*   `quantum/quantum_dream_adapter.py`: The `_run_dream_cycle` method was tagged with `#ΛDREAM_LOOP` and `#ΛDRIFT_POINT`.

### 2.4. Dream Output Integrity

The `process_dream_cycle` method in `memory/core_memory/dream_memory_manager.py` has been updated to include a conceptual `collapse_hash` and `drift_score` in the `dream_outcome`.

## 3. Bio-Inspired Core Audit

### 3.1. Symbolic Tags Introduced

The following symbolic tags were introduced to the bio-inspired core:

*   `#ΛTAG: bio`
*   `#ΛTAG: pulse`
*   `#ΛTAG: endocrine`

### 3.2. Drift-Aware Logic

Drift-aware safeguards were added to the `correct_phase_drift` method in `core/bio_orchestrator/orchestrator.py`. These safeguards include a drift threshold, a correction limit, and a drift log.

### 3.3. Cross-Links Between Symbolic Bio and Core Memory

The `memory/core_memory/dream_memory_manager.py` file is a key component of the dream module and is responsible for managing memory processes related to simulated dream states. This file is cross-linked with the symbolic bio core through the use of the `#ΛDREAM_LOOP` tag.

## 4. Conclusion

The LUKHAS dream module and bio-inspired core are complex and powerful systems, but they have several potential weaknesses that could lead to instability and misalignment. The recommendations in this report are intended to address these weaknesses and improve the overall integrity of the system.
