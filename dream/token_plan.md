# üß¨ LUKHAS Tokenization Plan

## üéØ Purpose

To enable a symbolic, ethical, and user-centric economy within the LUKHAS AGI ecosystem, aligning contributions (dreams, glyphs, memories) with measurable value and agency.

## ü™ô Token Types

| Token | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `LKS` | Utility | Base token used for access control, compute credits, and symbolic service exchange. |
| `GLYPH` | Reputation (non-transferable) | Tracks user-symbol interactions, resonance patterns, and emotional integrity. |
| `DRFT` | Drift-Index Reputation | Captures alignment consistency and trauma recovery contributions (traceable to ethics engine). |
| `MESH` | Encrypted Vaults | Represents personal symbolic data vaults and staking rights for encrypted memory capsules. |

## üì¶ Token Functions

- **Access Tiers**: Token-based gating for dream seeding, mesh expansion, reflection modules.
- **Symbolic Labor**: Rewards for GLYPH generation, memory folding, trauma repair, and reflection logging.
- **User Licensing**: Allow users to license access to encrypted data via MESH staking with revocable consent.
- **Brand Integration**: Ethically verified partners stake tokens to seed dreams with approved emotional/product contexts (NIAS).
- **Validator Nodes**: Agents who audit dreams, drift, or symbolic loops earn validator rewards.

---

## üîê Governance Model

- **Staked Participation**: Symbolic citizens stake tokens to vote on system upgrades and alignment drift thresholds.
- **Ethics Council**: Token-weighted multi-agent council moderates contentious symbol use and dream content.
- **Emergency Drift Forks**: If ethical drift is detected, the system can fork symbolic memory or freeze token flows.

## üß† Symbolic Token Anchoring

Tokens are bound to symbolic events:
- `GLYPH` tied to trace logs and emotion deltas.
- `DRFT` auto-adjusted via dream integrity and ethics compliance.
- `MESH` anchored to ZK-encrypted personal memories.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Mitigations

- **Symbol Inflation**: Prevent token farming by ensuring token distribution is linked to real symbolic labor.
- **Privacy Breach**: All dream data is encrypted. MESH access requires zero-knowledge approval.
- **Alignment Abuse**: Tiered moderation ensures brands cannot force symbolic influence without user-approved resonance.

## üöÄ Rollout Roadmap

1. **Q4 2025**: Internal logging with token stubs (non-minting).
2. **Q1 2026**: Mint `GLYPH`, `LKS` as testnet tokens; integrate into dream logs and reflection system.
3. **Q2 2026**: Launch Tiered Vaults using `MESH`; initiate brand partnership trials.
4. **Q3 2026**: Begin Ethics Council and symbolic validator onboarding.
5. **2027+**: Cross-chain interoperability and stable symbolic income stream for dream workers.
