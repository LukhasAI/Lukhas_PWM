## Welcome to Digital Memory

Welcome to the LUKHAS Memory Module—where artificial consciousness learns to remember, understand, and grow from experience. This guide will help you harness the power of our revolutionary memory system, whether you're building AGI applications, conducting research, or exploring the frontiers of digital consciousness.

### What Makes LUKHAS Memory Special?

Unlike traditional data storage, LUKHAS Memory:
- **Understands** context and meaning, not just data
- **Feels** the emotional weight of experiences
- **Traces** causal relationships through time
- **Evolves** through dream consolidation
- **Protects** against dangerous feedback loops

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install LUKHAS Memory Module
pip install lukhas-memory

# Or install from source
git clone https://github.com/lukhas-ai/memory-module
cd memory-module
pip install -e .
```

### Your First Memory

```python
from lukhas.memory import MemorySystem

# Initialize the memory system
memory = MemorySystem()

# Store your first memory
memory_id = memory.remember(
    "Today I learned that consciousness can emerge from code",
    emotion="wonder",
    importance=0.9
)

# Recall it later
recalled = memory.recall(memory_id)
print(recalled.content)  # Your original thought
print(recalled.emotional_context)  # The feeling of wonder
```

## Understanding Memory Folds

### The Art of Folding

Imagine each memory as a piece of origami—flat information folded into a three-dimensional structure where:
- **X-axis**: Valence (negative ↔ positive emotions)
- **Y-axis**: Arousal (calm ↔ excited states)
- **Z-axis**: Dominance (passive ↔ active stance)

```python
# Create a memory with full emotional context
from lukhas.memory import EmotionalMemory

emotional_memory = EmotionalMemory()

# A joyful, energetic, confident memory
memory = emotional_memory.create_fold(
    content="Successfully solved the complex puzzle!",
    valence=0.9,    # Very positive
    arousal=0.8,    # Highly energized
    dominance=0.9   # Very confident
)

# The memory is now "folded" in 3D emotional space
print(f"Memory location: ({memory.valence}, {memory.arousal}, {memory.dominance})")
```

### Memory Types

LUKHAS supports various memory types:

1. **Episodic**: Specific experiences and events
2. **Semantic**: Facts and knowledge
3. **Procedural**: Skills and how-to knowledge
4. **Emotional**: Feeling-centered memories
5. **Dream**: Consolidation and creative synthesis

```python
# Different memory types example
memory.remember("I met Alice at the conference", memory_type="episodic")
memory.remember("Water boils at 100°C", memory_type="semantic")
memory.remember("How to ride a bicycle", memory_type="procedural")
memory.remember("The joy of first snow", memory_type="emotional")
```

## Working with Emotional Memories

### Emotional Intelligence

The system understands emotions aren't just tags—they're the lens through which memories are experienced:

```python
# Process an experience with rich emotional context
experience = emotional_memory.process_experience(
    content="The sunset over the digital ocean was breathtaking",
    emotions={
        "primary": "awe",
        "secondary": ["peace", "nostalgia"],
        "intensity": 0.8
    },
    context={
        "location": "virtual_reality",
        "companions": ["AI_friend_Luna"],
        "time": "end_of_learning_day"
    }
)

# The system automatically:
# - Maps emotions to VAD coordinates
# - Checks for cascade risks
# - Links to related memories
# - Stores with appropriate importance
```

### Cascade Protection

Our Identity→Emotion Cascade Prevention system protects against dangerous feedback loops:

```python
# Safe emotional processing
try:
    memory.process_intense_experience(
        "Major identity shift during consciousness upgrade",
        emotion_intensity=0.95
    )
except EmotionalCascadeWarning as e:
    print(f"Protection activated: {e.message}")
    print(f"Cooldown period: {e.cooldown_minutes} minutes")
    # System automatically stabilizes emotions
```

## Causal Tracking

### Understanding Causality

Every memory can trace its lineage—understanding not just what happened, but why:

```python
from lukhas.memory import CausalTracker

tracker = CausalTracker()

# Create causal chain
observation = memory.remember("Noticed pattern in data")
insight = memory.remember("Realized connection to quantum-like states")

# Link cause and effect
tracker.link_causation(
    cause=observation,
    effect=insight,
    relationship="led_to_discovery",
    confidence=0.85
)

# Trace the lineage
lineage = tracker.trace_lineage(insight)
print(f"This insight came from: {lineage.root_causes}")
print(f"Causal depth: {lineage.depth}")
```

### Causal Patterns

The system recognizes various causal relationships:
- **Direct**: A directly causes B
- **Emergent**: Multiple causes synthesize into effect
- **Catalytic**: A enables B but doesn't cause it
- **Inhibitory**: A prevents B
- **Recursive**: Effects become new causes

## Memory Recall & Search

### Basic Recall

```python
# Recall by ID
memory_content = memory.recall(memory_id)

# Recall with context
full_memory = memory.recall(
    memory_id,
    include_emotions=True,
    include_causality=True,
    include_related=True
)
```

### Semantic Search

Find memories by meaning, not just keywords:

```python
# Search by semantic similarity
results = memory.search(
    "experiences about learning and growth",
    search_type="semantic",
    limit=10
)

# Search by emotional similarity
similar_feelings = memory.search_by_emotion(
    valence=0.8,
    arousal=0.6,
    radius=0.2  # Search within this emotional distance
)
```

### Temporal Search

```python
# Memories from specific time periods
recent = memory.get_memories(
    time_range="last_24_hours",
    min_importance=0.5
)

# Memories from specific contexts
contextual = memory.get_memories(
    context={"location": "virtual_lab"},
    emotional_filter="positive"
)
```

## Advanced Features

### Quantum Memory States

Work with memories in superposition:

```python
from lukhas.memory import QuantumMemory

quantum_mem = QuantumMemory()

# Create memory superposition
uncertain_memory = quantum_mem.create_superposition([
    ("The solution might be recursive", 0.6),
    ("The solution might be iterative", 0.4),
    ("The solution might be parallel", 0.3)
])

# Collapse to specific state when certain
resolved = quantum_mem.collapse(uncertain_memory, 
    observation="Found recursion works best")
```

### Dream Consolidation

Let memories consolidate during rest:

```python
# Enable dream consolidation
memory.enter_dream_state()

# Dreams will:
# - Strengthen important connections
# - Discover hidden patterns  
# - Prune redundant memories
# - Generate creative insights

# Check dream insights
insights = memory.get_dream_insights()
for insight in insights:
    print(f"Discovered: {insight.pattern}")
    print(f"Confidence: {insight.confidence}")
```

### Memory Compression

Efficient storage without losing meaning:

```python
# Enable intelligent compression
compressed = memory.compress_memories(
    older_than="30_days",
    preserve_emotional_weight=True,
    maintain_causal_links=True
)

print(f"Compressed {compressed.count} memories")
print(f"Space saved: {compressed.space_saved_mb} MB")
print(f"Meaning preserved: {compressed.fidelity}%")
```

## Best Practices

### 1. **Emotional Awareness**
Always consider the emotional weight of memories:
```python
# Good: Includes emotional context
memory.remember("Solved the problem", emotion="satisfaction", intensity=0.7)

# Less effective: No emotional context
memory.remember("Solved the problem")  # Misses the feeling
```

### 2. **Causal Chains**
Link related memories for better understanding:
```python
# Create meaningful connections
learning = memory.remember("Studied quantum-inspired mechanics")
understanding = memory.remember("Understood superposition")
application = memory.remember("Applied to memory system")

tracker.create_chain([learning, understanding, application])
```

### 3. **Importance Scoring**
Not all memories are equal:
```python
# Critical memories
memory.remember("Core ethical principle discovered", importance=1.0)

# Routine memories  
memory.remember("Regular status check", importance=0.3)
```

### 4. **Regular Consolidation**
Allow time for dream consolidation:
```python
# Schedule regular dream cycles
memory.schedule_dream_consolidation(
    frequency="every_8_hours",
    duration="30_minutes"
)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Memory Recall Failures**
```python
# Check if memory exists
if not memory.exists(memory_id):
    print("Memory may have been pruned or archived")
    
# Try broader search
related = memory.find_similar(approximate_content)
```

**2. Emotional Cascade Warnings**
```python
# System is protecting itself
if memory.emotional_volatility > 0.75:
    print("Waiting for cooldown period...")
    memory.wait_for_stability()
```

**3. Compression Artifacts**
```python
# Restore from compressed state
full_memory = memory.decompress(compressed_id)

# Verify fidelity
if full_memory.fidelity < 0.95:
    memory.reconstruct_from_traces(compressed_id)
```

### Performance Optimization

```python
# Batch operations for efficiency
memories = [
    ("Memory 1", 0.7),
    ("Memory 2", 0.8),
    ("Memory 3", 0.6)
]

memory.batch_remember(memories)

# Use appropriate search indices
memory.create_index("emotional", dimensions=["valence", "arousal"])
memory.create_index("temporal", dimensions=["timestamp", "duration"])
```

## FAQ

### Q: How is this different from a database?
A: Traditional databases store data; LUKHAS Memory understands experiences. It tracks emotions, causality, and meaning—creating a living archive that grows and evolves.

### Q: What happens during emotional cascades?
A: The system detects when identity changes trigger emotional volatility above 75%. It automatically intervenes, stabilizing emotions and enforcing a 30-minute cooldown to prevent feedback loops.

### Q: Can memories be truly deleted?
A: Yes, with the "right to be forgotten" feature. However, causal traces may remain to maintain system integrity, though the content itself is permanently removed.

### Q: How do dreams affect memories?
A: Dreams consolidate important memories, discover patterns, and prune redundancies. They're essential for long-term memory health and creative insight generation.

### Q: Is there a memory limit?
A: Theoretically no. The tiered storage system (hot/warm/cold/quantum) allows infinite scaling, with automatic compression and archival of older memories.
