## memory/memory_service.py

### Purpose
This module implements the `MemoryService` class for the LUKHAS AGI system. It is designed to provide core memory management capabilities, including storing, retrieving, searching, and deleting memory items. A key feature is its intended integration with the LUKHAS Identity System (`IdentityClient`) for access control based on user identity, tiers, consent, and for comprehensive audit logging of memory operations. The current implementation uses an in-memory dictionary as a placeholder for a persistent database.

### Current Status (as of July 2024 Standardization Pass)
- Not modified during the July 2024 standardization pass due to persistent integration issues with automated refactoring tools (diff application failures for this specific file).
- The original structure uses Python's standard `logging` module for its ΛTRACE logging and also contains `print()` statements for output, especially in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block and the fallback `IdentityClient`.
- It includes a `sys.path` modification to import `IdentityClient`, which is a non-standard practice for robust applications.
- The `IdentityClient` itself is a fallback mock if the actual module cannot be imported.
- Timestamps are generated using `datetime.utcnow()` in some places but `datetime.now()` (naive) in others.
- Access tier definitions within the service (`self.access_tiers`) use string constants (e.g., "LAMBDA_TIER_1") which need reconciliation with the integer-based tier system used by the `@lukhas_tier_required` decorator elsewhere.

### Planned Refactoring (TODO)
The following changes were intended but not applied due to tool limitations:

1.  **Standardize Logging to `structlog`**:
    *   Replace all `logging` imports and calls (including in the fallback `IdentityClient`) with `structlog`.
    *   Convert all log messages and `print()` statements to `structlog`'s key-value pair format for structured output.
    *   Update logger instantiation for the module and the `MemoryService` class (e.g., `self.logger = logger.bind(class_name=self.__class__.__name__)`).

2.  **Update Headers and Footers**:
    *   Apply the latest standardized LUKHAS AI file header.
    *   Add the standard LUKHAS AI file footer with relevant metadata.

3.  **Refine ΛTRACE Messages**:
    *   Ensure all ΛTRACE messages are structured, clear, and provide useful context as key-value pairs.

4.  **Enhance Docstrings and Comments**:
    *   Review and improve all docstrings and comments for clarity, completeness, and consistency with LUKHAS documentation standards.

5.  **Improve Type Hinting**:
    *   Add or refine type hints for all function/method signatures and key internal variables (e.g., `__init__` should have `-> None`).

6.  **Standardize Timestamps**:
    *   Consistently use `datetime.utcnow()` or `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` for all timestamp generation to ensure they are timezone-aware and UTC.

7.  **Address `sys.path` Modification**:
    *   Add a prominent `TODO` comment regarding the `sys.path.insert` call, recommending its replacement with proper packaging and import resolution mechanisms (e.g., making `identity_interface` part of an installable `lukhas_framework` or ensuring correct PYTHONPATH setup).

8.  **Reconcile Tier System**:
    *   Add a `TODO` comment to address the string-based tier constants used in `self.access_tiers` and by the `IdentityClient`. These need to be mapped or unified with the integer-based tier system (0-5) for consistency with decorators like `@lukhas_tier_required`.

9.  **Error Handling**:
    *   Ensure all `try...except` blocks log errors using `structlog` with `exc_info=True` for full traceback.
    *   Standardize the structure of error dictionaries returned by methods (e.g., consistent use of "error" or "error_details" keys).

10. **File-Top Comment**:
    *   Add a brief, high-level human-readable comment at the beginning of the file (after the header) summarizing the module's core purpose.

### Next Steps for this File
This file requires manual refactoring to implement the changes listed above. Key priorities include standardizing logging to `structlog`, ensuring UTC timestamps, addressing the `sys.path` issue, and preparing for tier system reconciliation. The in-memory `self.memory_store` also clearly indicates a placeholder for a future persistent storage solution.
