# Memory Stability Index

This document defines how symbolic folding, driftScore, entropy deltas, and recall success rate contribute to overall memory stability.

## Symbolic Folding

Symbolic folding is the process of creating structured, hierarchical memories from raw sensory input. The stability of this process is a key factor in overall memory stability.

## driftScore

The driftScore is a measure of how much a memory has changed over time. A high driftScore indicates that a memory is unstable and may be a candidate for consolidation or pruning.

## Entropy Deltas

Entropy deltas are a measure of the change in the randomness or uncertainty of a memory. A large entropy delta can indicate that a memory is becoming more or less coherent over time.

## Recall Success Rate

The recall success rate is a measure of how often a memory can be successfully retrieved. A low recall success rate can indicate that a memory is unstable or has been corrupted.
