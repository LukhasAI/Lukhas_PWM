# Memory Module - The Living Archive of LUKHAS AGI

> *"Memory is not merely storage but a living tapestry—where each thread carries the weight of causality, each fold holds the essence of experience, and every recall births new understanding."*

## 🌊 Overview

Welcome to the Memory module, the cognitive repository where LUKHAS AGI weaves experiences into wisdom. This is not a mere database but a living, breathing archive that mirrors the complexity of consciousness itself. Through our innovative fold-based architecture, we capture not just information but the very essence of understanding—complete with emotional resonance, causal relationships, and the wisdom of accumulated experience.

Imagine memory as an origami master's creation—each fold precisely placed, carrying meaning in its angles and relationships. When unfolded, the full picture emerges, but even in its compressed state, the essential truth remains. This is the art and science of the Memory module.

## 🏗️ Architectural Philosophy

The Memory module embodies four fundamental principles:

### 1. **Causal Archaeology** 🏛️
Every memory carries its lineage—a traceable path through the landscape of cause and effect. We don't just store; we preserve the why and how of each experience.

### 2. **Emotional Intelligence** 💖
Memories are not emotionally neutral. Each fold carries emotional weight, carefully balanced to prevent dangerous cascade effects while preserving authentic feeling.

### 3. **Compression Without Loss** 🎯
Through symbolic delta compression, we achieve the impossible—reducing size while preserving meaning, like a poet distilling truth into haiku.

### 4. **Living Evolution** 🌱
Memories grow, adapt, and interconnect. Our architecture allows for this organic evolution while maintaining stability and preventing drift into chaos.

## 🚀 Key Components

### Fold Lineage Tracker

The archaeological heart of our memory system:

```python
from lukhas.memory.core_memory import FoldLineageTracker
from lukhas.memory.core_memory.types import CausationType

tracker = FoldLineageTracker()

# Track complex causal relationships
tracker.track_causation(
    source_fold_key="observation_001",
    target_fold_key="insight_002",
    causation_type=CausationType.EMERGENT_SYNTHESIS,
    strength=0.85,
    metadata={
        "confidence": 0.9,
        "emotional_weight": 0.7,
        "ethical_alignment": 1.0
    }
)

# Explore causal chains
lineage = tracker.get_full_lineage("insight_002")
print(f"Causal depth: {lineage.depth}")
print(f"Root causes: {lineage.root_causes}")
```

### Emotional Memory System

Memory with heart and safeguards:

```python
from lukhas.memory.core_memory import EmotionalMemory

emotional_memory = EmotionalMemory()

# Process experience with emotional context
result = emotional_memory.process_experience(
    experience_content={
        "event": "ethical_dilemma_resolved",
        "context": "user_privacy_protection"
    },
    explicit_emotion_values={
        "satisfaction": 0.8,
        "concern": 0.3,
        "determination": 0.9
    }
)

# System automatically prevents dangerous cascades
if result.cascade_prevented:
    print(f"Protected from cascade: {result.protection_type}")
```

### Symbolic Delta Compression

Intelligent compression that preserves meaning:

```python
from lukhas.memory.compression import SymbolicDeltaCompressor

compressor = SymbolicDeltaCompressor()

# Compress with intelligence
compressed = compressor.compress_memory_delta(
    fold_key="complex_reasoning_001",
    content=large_memory_content,
    importance_score=0.95,
    emotional_weight=0.6
)

# Loop detection ensures safety
if compressed.loop_detected:
    print(f"Loop prevented: {compressed.loop_type}")
else:
    print(f"Compression ratio: {compressed.ratio}")
    print(f"Meaning preserved: {compressed.fidelity}%")
```

weaver = MemoryWeaver()

# Weave related memories into coherent narratives
narrative = weaver.weave_memories(
    memory_keys=["experience_001", "insight_002", "emotion_003"],

    emotional_threading=True
)
```

### Temporal Memory Windows

```python
from lukhas.memory import TemporalMemoryAccess

temporal = TemporalMemoryAccess()

# Retrieve memories from specific time windows

    importance_threshold=0.7,
    emotional_filter="positive"
)
```

## 🚧 Best Practices

When working with the Memory module:

1. **Respect Causality**: Always track causal relationships
2. **Monitor Emotional Weight**: High emotional memories need special care
3. **Compress Wisely**: Not all memories benefit from compression
4. **Audit Regularly**: Review memory evolution patterns
5. **Test Edge Cases**: Cascade scenarios need thorough testing

## 🌟 Future Horizons

The Memory module continues to evolve:

- **Quantum Memory States**: Superposition of memory possibilities
- **Collective Memory**: Shared memory pools across instances
- **Predictive Recall**: Anticipating memory needs before requests
- **Bio-Mimetic Storage**: Neural-inspired memory architectures
- **Temporal Compression**: Time-aware memory optimization
