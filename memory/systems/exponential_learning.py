# FILENAME: memory/core_memory/exponential_learning.py
# VERSION: 1.2.0 # Updated version
# TIER SYSTEM: Tier 2 (Core Learning Functionality, conceptual via @lukhas_tier_required)
# ΛTRACE INTEGRATION: ENABLED (via structlog)
# CAPABILITIES: Implements a conceptual exponential learning system that manages
#               an internal knowledge base (memory). Growth in learning effectiveness
#               is modeled by a growth factor applied over adaptation cycles.
# FUNCTIONS: None directly exposed beyond class methods.
# CLASSES: ExponentialLearningSystem
# DECORATORS: @lukhas_tier_required (conceptual)
# DEPENDENCIES: typing, datetime, structlog
# INTERFACES: Public methods: incorporate_experience, get_status.
# ERROR HANDLING: Relies on Python's default error handling for stubbed methods.
#                 Logs warnings for stubbed functionalities.
# LOGGING: ΛTRACE_ENABLED (uses structlog for debug, info, warning messages).
# AUTHENTICATION: Tiering is conceptual. No direct user identity management.
# HOW TO USE:
#   learning_system = ExponentialLearningSystem(learning_rate=0.05, growth_factor=1.02)
#   experience = {"type": "observation", "data_points": [1,2,3]}
#   learning_system.incorporate_experience(experience)
#   status = learning_system.get_status()
# INTEGRATION NOTES: This module is highly conceptual due to stubbed core logic
#   (pattern extraction, knowledge update, consolidation). Its actual learning
#   behavior and memory management depend entirely on the implementation of these stubs.
#   The "knowledge_base" it manages is its primary memory component.
# MAINTENANCE: Implement all STUBBED methods for full functionality.
#   Define robust schemas for `experience_data`, `patterns`, and `knowledge_base` entries.
#   Develop sophisticated algorithms for pattern extraction, knowledge update, and consolidation
#   that align with the "exponential learning" concept.
#   Consider adding mechanisms for forgetting or attenuating old/irrelevant knowledge.
