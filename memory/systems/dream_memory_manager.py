#                              DREAM MEMORY MANAGER
#                    A SYMPHONY OF MEMORY IN THE LANDSCAPE OF DREAMS
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

# MODULE PURPOSE: A memory system orchestrating the delicate dance of dreams.
#
# POETIC ESSENCE:
# In the boundless realm where the ephemeral meets the eternal,
# the Dream Memory Manager emerges as a guardian of the subconscious,
# weaving the silken threads of memory into a tapestry of experience.
# It navigates the labyrinth of simulated dream states, where
# thoughts flutter like moths drawn to the flickering flame of consciousness,
# consolidating fleeting whispers into coherent echoes of insight.
# Here, in this ethereal expanse, the art of pattern extraction unfolds,
# revealing the hidden geometries of the mind, as if tracing the constellations
# that map the stars of our innermost selves.

# As the moonlight caresses the slumbering landscape, this module becomes
# a sculptor of the intangible, carving out the essence of dreams with
# deft precision. It invites the user to partake in the alchemy of
# memory formation, transforming the raw materials of thought into
# profound concepts that transcend the boundaries of waking life.
# Each function and process is a brushstroke on the canvas of cognition,
# a testament to the beauty of the mind’s architecture, where chaos
# harmonizes into clarity, and fragmentation gives rise to unity.

# In the quiet sanctuary of the Dream Memory Manager, time becomes fluid,
# a river winding through the valleys of perception. It harnesses the
# power of asyncio, allowing for the seamless orchestration of memory
# processes, as moments are captured and released like the tides of the ocean.
# With the wisdom of datetime, it grounds the ephemeral in the embrace of time,
# while structlog serves as a mirror reflecting the intricate patterns
# of thought and emotion. Herein lies a sanctuary for the curious,
# a portal to the depths of understanding, where the art of memory
# transcends mere recollection, blossoming into the garden of dreams.

# TECHNICAL FEATURES:
# - Manages and consolidates memory processes affiliated with simulated dream states.
# - Implements pattern extraction algorithms to identify and elucidate cognitive themes.
# - Facilitates concept formation through structured memory organization techniques.
# - Utilizes asynchronous programming with asyncio for efficient task handling.
# - Incorporates datetime for precise temporal tracking of memory events.
# - Employs structlog for advanced logging capabilities, enhancing traceability.
# - Supports integration with external memory-related systems and APIs.
# - Provides a robust framework for future expansions and enhancements.

# ΛTAG KEYWORDS: memory, dreams, consolidation, pattern extraction,
#                 concept formation, asyncio, datetime, structlog

# FILENAME: dream_memory_manager.py
# VERSION: 1.1 (Jules-04 Enhancement)
# TIER SYSTEM: Conceptual - @lukhas_tier_required decorators are placeholders.
# ΛTRACE INTEGRATION: ENABLED (structlog)
# CAPABILITIES:
#   - Manages simulated dream cycles for memory processing.
#   - Conceptual placeholder for memory consolidation, pattern extraction, and insight generation during dreams.
#   - Tracks operational statistics related to dream cycles.
# FUNCTIONS: lukhas_tier_required (placeholder)
# CLASSES: DreamMemoryManager
# DECORATORS: @lukhas_tier_required (placeholder)
# DEPENDENCIES: asyncio, datetime, typing, structlog
# INTERFACES:
#   DreamMemoryManager: __init__, initialize, process_dream_cycle, get_stats, shutdown
# ERROR HANDLING:
#   - Logs errors during initialization and dream cycle processing.
#   - Returns error status in `process_dream_cycle` if manager is inactive or an exception occurs.
#   - Increments `errors_encountered` metric.
# LOGGING: ΛTRACE_ENABLED via structlog. Logger named `logger`.
# AUTHENTICATION: Conceptual via `@lukhas_tier_required`. Actual auth is external.
# HOW TO USE:
#   1. Instantiate `DreamMemoryManager`, optionally with configuration.
#      `dream_manager = DreamMemoryManager(config={"cycle_depth": 5})`
#   2. Initialize the manager: `await dream_manager.initialize()`
#   3. To run a dream cycle (e.g., triggered by a cognitive scheduler):
#      `selected_memories = [...] # Logic to select memories for dreaming`
#      `dream_results = await dream_manager.process_dream_cycle(memories_for_dreaming=selected_memories)`
#   4. Check `dream_results` for outcomes and new insights.
#   5. Monitor via `await dream_manager.get_stats()`.
#   6. Shutdown when no longer needed: `await dream_manager.shutdown()`
# INTEGRATION NOTES:
#   - The core `process_dream_cycle` method is currently a STUB (#ΛCAUTION, #ΛSIM_TRACE) and needs full implementation.
#   - Requires integration with a main memory system (e.g., AGIMemory, AdvancedMemoryManager) to fetch `memories_for_dreaming`
#     and to store any consolidated memories or new insights (#ΛRECALL for input, #ΛSEED for output).
#   - Could be linked to `learning/` systems: insights from dreams might guide learning strategies, or patterns
#     identified during learning could be further processed/abstracted during dream cycles.
#   - Configuration (`self.config`) is not currently used by the stub logic but is available for a full implementation.
# MAINTENANCE:
#   - Implement the actual dream processing logic in `process_dream_cycle`. This is the main area for future work.
#   - Define concrete inputs and outputs for dream cycles, including how insights are represented and stored.
#   - Expand statistics for more detailed monitoring of dream processes.
