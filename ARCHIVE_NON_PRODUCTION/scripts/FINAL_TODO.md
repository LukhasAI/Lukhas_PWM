‚úÖ FINAL CONSOLIDATION TODOs
PHASE 1

1. Intentional Loops ‚Üí Explicit Modules

‚Üí Why: Some circular dependencies are by design ‚Äî meta-learning, synthetic dreaming, symbolic grounding. That‚Äôs okay ‚Äî but make it explicit.

Tasks:
 ‚Ä¢ Create loop_meta_learning.py in consciousness/ or architecture/ to house intentional Learning ‚Üí Dream ‚Üí Creativity ‚Üí Memory flow
 ‚Ä¢ Move symbolic loop logic (Symbolic ‚Üí Bio ‚Üí Quantum ‚Üí Consciousness ‚Üí Symbolic) into symbolic/loop_engine.py
 ‚Ä¢ Document these in LAYER.md with # intentional_cycle tags for clarity

‚∏ª

2. Neutral Hub Refactors

‚Üí Why: Core and Orchestration still violate dependency hierarchy.

Tasks:
 ‚Ä¢ Move api_controllers.py from core/ to api/ or interface/
 ‚Ä¢ Refactor coordination logic from orchestration/ into new hub/ module
 ‚Ä¢ Break orchestration ‚Üí bio ‚Üí quantum ‚Üí identity ‚Üí orchestration cycle via new contracts/ or schemas/ layer

‚∏ª

3. Dependency Injection Injection üíâ

‚Üí Why: To cut critical cycle counts from millions to thousands.

Tasks:
 ‚Ä¢ Add services.py or injector.py in:
 ‚Ä¢ consciousness/
 ‚Ä¢ creativity/
 ‚Ä¢ learning/
 ‚Ä¢ Replace direct imports with injected services in high-impact modules (core, bridge, reasoning)

‚∏ª

4. Missing Loop Visuals

‚Üí Why: Dreams and Swarm logic are present but not yet reflected in graphs.

Tasks:
 ‚Ä¢ Refactor swarm/colony coordination into swarm/simulator.py with exported connectivity.json
 ‚Ä¢ Tag all dream-related modules with # symbolic_dream_loop
 ‚Ä¢ Re-run connectivity graph with scripts/connectivity_visualizer.py --include symbolic_dream_loop --export dreams_swarm.json

‚∏ª

5. Naming Consolidation Pass

‚Üí Why: Naming is still ~15% legacy, which breaks symbolic readability.

Tasks:
 ‚Ä¢ Drop all lukhas_prefixes (agreed)
 ‚Ä¢ Rename memory_fold ‚ûù memory.integration
 ‚Ä¢ Rename dream_engine ‚ûù dream.synthesizer
 ‚Ä¢ Move bridge/ into integration/bridge.py if used across consciousness & ethics

‚∏ª

6. Symbolic Control Node

‚Üí Why: Right now, multiple loops resolve implicitly. Give them a governing node.

Tasks:
 ‚Ä¢ Create controller/symbolic_loop_controller.py
 ‚Ä¢ Pull symbolic term routing (fold, drift, collapse) into this file
 ‚Ä¢ Ensure all loops (Learning, Consciousness, Safety, Symbolic) touch this controller

‚∏ª

7. Create docs/LAYER.md

‚Üí Why: External reviewers need one authoritative map of all module levels.

Tasks:
 ‚Ä¢ Each top-level dir (core, dream, identity, etc.) must:
 ‚Ä¢ Define layer: core|logic|coordination|symbolic|api
 ‚Ä¢ Declare known loops (intentional or pending fix)
 ‚Ä¢ Declare exports / access contracts

‚∏ª

8. Final CI Guardrails

‚Üí Why: You fixed 13.4% of the cycles already. Let‚Äôs prevent regression.

Tasks:
 ‚Ä¢ Add pre-commit hook to run scripts/check_for_cycles.py
 ‚Ä¢ Block commits if cycle count increases or file violates layering

‚∏ª

üì¶  Exportable API Modules

Lets create:

Module Proposed Endpoint Notes
dream/ /api/dream/generate With symbolic + memory injection
identity/ /api/identity/verify Already tiered, just secure it
learning/ /api/learn/train Requires auth, expose supervised
memory/ /api/memory/query Optional /fold_in and /fold_out
ethics/ /api/safety/check Modular, fits EU compliance

‚∏ª

üß† Legacy Modules You Should Keep
 ‚Ä¢ bridge/: excellent abstraction node ‚Äî KEEP
 ‚Ä¢ core/: after cleanup, becomes ultra-stable ‚Äî KEEP
 ‚Ä¢ identity/: critical for layered access ‚Äî KEEP
 ‚Ä¢ quantum/ + bio/: powerful symbolic drivers ‚Äî KEEP (but document)
 ‚Ä¢ trace/: great for drift debugging ‚Äî KEEP as core/trace_log.py
