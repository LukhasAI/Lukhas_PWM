# Orchestration Directory — LUKHAS_AGI_2

This directory contains advanced orchestration modules for compliance, ethics, emotional modulation, and secure symbolic flows in the LUKHAS_AGI_2 system. Each file plays a unique role in the AGI's safe, explainable, and auditable operation.

## File Overview

### `emotional_oscillator.py`
A compliance-safe emotional oscillator for subsystem-level emotional modulation. 
- **Purpose:** Modulates emotional state using amplitude, frequency, and phase, with strict parameter limits for regulatory compliance (EU AI Act, GDPR, ISO/IEC 27001).
- **Usage:**
  ```python
  from emotional_oscillator import EmotionalOscillator
  osc = EmotionalOscillator(base_frequency=1.0, base_amplitude=0.8)
  value = osc.modulate_emotion(time_step=0.5)
  osc.adjust_parameters(frequency=2.0)
  ```
- **Terminal Test:**
  ```bash
  python3 -c "from emotional_oscillator import EmotionalOscillator; print(EmotionalOscillator().modulate_emotion(0.5))"
  ```
- **Fine Tuning:**
  - Adjust `base_frequency`, `base_amplitude`, and `phase_shift` for different emotional profiles.
  - Use `adjust_parameters()` to dynamically adapt to subsystem needs.

### `the_oscillator.py`
A constitutionally-aligned, quantum-enhanced orchestration layer for AGI-level compliance, ethics, and decision-making.
- **Purpose:**
  - Integrates global compliance frameworks (multi-region legal checks)
  - Implements ethical hierarchy and quantum decision logic
  - Real-time regulatory monitoring and emotional tone modulation
  - Stakeholder impact assessment and post-market drift monitoring
- **Usage:**
  ```python
  from the_oscillator import LucasAGI
  agi = LucasAGI()
  result = agi.process_decision({"climate": True, "personal_data": "test"})
  print(result)
  ```
- **Terminal Test:**
  ```bash
  python3 the_oscillator.py
  ```
- **Fine Tuning:**
  - Update compliance profiles in `GlobalComplianceFramework` for new laws
  - Adjust ethical weights in `EthicalHierarchy`
  - Add/modify sound files for emotional tone feedback

### `guardian_orchestrator.py`
CLI and logic for testing the GuardianEngine’s fallback and override mechanisms.
- **Purpose:** Simulates trust breaches, post-quantum fallback, and quorum-based overrides for system resilience.
- **Usage:**
  ```bash
  python3 guardian_orchestrator.py
  ```
- **Fine Tuning:**
  - Integrate with real multisig validators or external trust monitors
  - Adjust fallback/override logic for new security requirements

---

### `orchestrator_core.py`
The central symbolic orchestrator for SEEDRA.
- **Purpose:** Routes encrypted symbolic events to core modules (vault, ethics, guardian, validator, IPFS, and Lukhas narration). Acts as the “spinal cord” for ethical reflexes and secure event resolution.
- **Usage:**
  ```python
  from orchestrator_core import OrchestratorCore
  OrchestratorCore().simulate_trust_flow()
  ```
- **Fine Tuning:**
  - Connect new modules or event types
  - Extend narration or logging for transparency

---

### `__init__.py`
Marks this directory as a Python package.

## General Fine-Tuning & Development Tips
- **Compliance:** Always review and update compliance logic for new regulations.
- **Testing:** Use the provided CLI/terminal commands to simulate edge cases and stress-test safeguards.
- **Extensibility:** Each orchestrator is modular—extend or replace components as AGI requirements evolve.
- **Logging:** All modules use Python logging for auditability. Check logs for compliance events, ethical decisions, and fallback triggers.
