"""
Service Registry for LUKHAS AI System

This module provides a centralized registry for high-level services (learning, etc.)
to avoid circular dependencies between core and feature modules.

Architecture principle: core → memory → orchestration → consciousness → features → api
Services registered here can be accessed by core modules without importing from higher layers.
