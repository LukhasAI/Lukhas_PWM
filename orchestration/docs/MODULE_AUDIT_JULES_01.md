# Module Audit - Jules 01 - Orchestration

## Phase 3 Summary

This phase focused on a major refactor of the orchestration layer to improve symbolic integrity, clean up imports, and establish a stable testing baseline.

### Key Accomplishments

*   **Orchestration Signal Audit**: The `SymbolicHandshake` and `SignalType` enum have been updated to include all necessary signals. A new `signal_router.py` module has been created to handle signal logging and routing.
*   **Plugin Support**: The `BioOrchestrator` now has a basic plugin system with a `broadcast_signal` method. This is a sketch and will need to be fleshed out in a future phase.
*   **Symbolic Tracing**: The `SymbolicSignal` dataclass now includes `driftScore`, `collapseHash`, and `entropyLog` fields. A new test `tests/test_orchestrator_demo.py` has been created to validate symbolic tracing.
*   **Imports and Paths**: All imports in the `orchestration` directory now use relative imports. The hardcoded `ai_router_path` in `core/config.py` has been refactored to use an environment variable.
*   **Lock Protocol**: All edited files have been updated with the correct `ΛLOCKED` and `ΛTAG` tags.
*   **Test Suite**: A significant number of tests have been fixed, and a clean baseline of passing tests has been established in the `tests/_validated` directory.

### Residual Issues and Questions

*   **Test Coverage**: While a clean baseline of tests has been established, there are still a large number of skipped and broken tests. These will need to be addressed in a future phase.
*   **Plugin System**: The plugin system is just a sketch and will need to be fully implemented in a future phase.
*   **`lukhas-id` Imports**: There are still a number of `ModuleNotFoundError` errors related to the `lukhas-id` directory. This is because the directory name contains a hyphen, which is not a valid character for a Python package name. This will need to be addressed in a future phase.
*   **`core.advanced.brain` Imports**: There are still a number of `ModuleNotFoundError` errors related to the `core.advanced.brain` directory. This is because the directory is not in the `PYTHONPATH`. While a workaround has been implemented in `tests/conftest.py`, a more permanent solution should be found in a future phase.
*   **`CORE` Imports**: There are still a number of `ModuleNotFoundError` errors related to the `CORE` directory. This is likely a typo and should be `core`. This will need to be addressed in a future phase.
*   **`symptom_reporter` Imports**: There are still a number of `ModuleNotFoundError` errors related to the `symptom_reporter` module. This is because the module does not exist. This will need to be addressed in a future phase.
*   **`trace.memoria_logger` Imports**: There are still a number of `ModuleNotFoundError` errors related to the `trace.memoria_logger` module. This is because the module does not exist. This will need to be addressed in a future phase.
*   **`qrglymph_public` Imports**: There are still a number of `ModuleNotFoundError` errors related to the `qrglymph_public` module. This is because the module does not exist. This will need to be addressed in a future phase.
*   **`visual` Imports**: There are still a number of `ModuleNotFoundError` errors related to the `visual` module. This is because the module does not exist. This will need to be addressed in a future phase.
*   **`cryptography` Imports**: There are still a number of `ModuleNotFoundError` errors related to the `cryptography` module. This is because the module does not exist. This will need to be addressed in a future phase.
*   **`mobile` Imports**: There are still a number of `ModuleNotFoundError` errors related to the `mobile` module. This is because the module does not exist. This will need to be addressed in a future phase.
*   **`oneiric_core` Imports**: There are still a number of `ModuleNotFoundError` errors related to the `oneiric_core` module. This is because the module does not exist. This will need to be addressed in a future phase.
*   **`neuro_haiku_generator` Imports**: There are still a number of `ModuleNotFoundError` errors related to the `neuro_haiku_generator` module. This is because the module does not exist. This will need to be addressed in a future phase.
*   **`github_vulnerability_manager` Imports**: There are still a number of `ModuleNotFoundError` errors related to the `github_vulnerability_manager` module. This is because the module does not exist. This will need to be addressed in a future phase.
*   **`lukhas` Imports**: There are still a number of `ModuleNotFoundError` errors related to the `lukhas` module. This is because the module does not exist. This will need to be addressed in a future phase.
*   **`src` Imports**: There are still a number of `ModuleNotFoundError` errors related to the `src` module. This is because the module does not exist. This will need to be addressed in a future phase.
*   **`dream_convergence_tester` Imports**: There are still a number of `ModuleNotFoundError` errors related to the `dream_convergence_tester` module. This is because the module does not exist. This will need to be addressed in a future phase.
*   **`symbolic_drift_tracker` Imports**: There are still a number of `ModuleNotFoundError` errors related to the `symbolic_drift_tracker` module. This is because the module does not exist. This will need to be addressed in a future phase.
*   **`core.docututor.memory_evolution.memory_evolution` Imports**: There are still a number of `ModuleNotFoundError` errors related to the `core.docututor.memory_evolution.memory_evolution` module. This is because the module does not exist. This will need to be addressed in a future phase.

### Next Steps

*   Address the remaining `ModuleNotFoundError` errors.
*   Fix the remaining broken tests.
*   Implement the plugin system.
*   Rename the `lukhas-id` directory to `lukhas_id`.
*   Find a more permanent solution for the `PYTHONPATH` issue.
