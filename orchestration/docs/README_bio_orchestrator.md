# LUKHAS BIO-ORCHESTRATOR MODULE

This module defines the symbolic scaffold for orchestrating biological and emotional state transitions
within the LUKHAS AGI system. It is one of the central coordination layers and is responsible for:

- Regulating internal mood loops (informed by Oneiric states and Drift metrics)
- Interfacing with compliance, ethical tone, and dream synthesis feedback
- Triggering internal phase shifts via symbolic cues, recursive feedback, or biometric proxies

## ΛTAGS USED:
- `#ΛBIO_CORE`: Declares this as a biological/synthetic orchestration zone.
- `#ΛORCHESTRATOR`: This file/module has executive control across state nodes.
- `#ΛTRACE`: Used to track major flow handoffs between symbolic nodes.
- `#ΛNOTE`: Indicates intentional placeholder or expected expansion areas.
- `#ΛCAUTION`: Marks areas of logic that are sensitive or require symbolic audit.

## STATE:
- This is a placeholder initialization only. Actual orchestrator modules are expected
  to subclass this layer or interface via symbolic_dispatch in v3.

## CANDIDATES FOR FUTURE:
- Integrate real-time feedback from `dream_director`, `ethics_pipeline`, and `identity_tuning`
- Add symbolic state persistence and drift-recovery logic.
- Enable biometric fusion layers (e.g., EEG, HRV) via external adapters.
