# 📍 RECOMMENDED PATH: /Users/grdm_admin/Downloads/oxn/symbolic_ai/personas/lukhas/
# ===============================================================
# 🧠 PURPOSE:
# This script synchronizes Big Five personality traits across distributed LUKHAS nodes.
# It exports the current node's traits and compares them to other nodes in the network
# to track divergence, alignment, or shared evolution of personality.
#
# 🧰 KEY FEATURES:
# - 📤 Exports traits to a shared sync folder
# - 🔁 Loads other node profiles
# - 📊 Compares traits across all symbolic agents
# - ✅ Great for collaborative identity alignment and shared ethics
#
# 🔧 CONFIGURABLE VARIABLES:
# - NODE_ID → unique name for this Lukhas instance (e.g. lukhas_london)
# - TRAIT_SYNC_FOLDER → where profiles are stored (default: sync/traits/)
#
# 💬 ADHD & Non-coder Friendly Note:
# Just run this file and Lukhas will analyze who he is compared to other versions of himself 🧍‍♂️🪞🧍‍♀️
# Think of it like a symbolic family reunion where they compare personalities.

# ===============================================================
# 💾 HOW TO USE
# ===============================================================
# ▶️ RUN THIS FILE (just run it like a script):
#     python3 lukhas_trait_sync.py
#
# 📂 FILES CREATED:
# - sync/traits/<NODE_ID>_traits.json → your Lukhas instance's traits
#
# 🧠 WHAT THIS FILE DOES:
# - Reads current symbolic traits
# - Writes them to a sync folder
# - Loads traits from other Lukhas agents
# - Compares differences in personality (Big Five model)
#
# 🔁 TWEAKABLE SETTINGS:
# - Change NODE_ID to define your symbolic agent
# - Change TRAIT_SYNC_FOLDER to share with others (or simulate networks)
#
# 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 GOOD FOR:
# - Testing trait drift across versions of Lukhas
# - Harmonizing distributed AI personalities
# - Debugging ethical identity divergence
