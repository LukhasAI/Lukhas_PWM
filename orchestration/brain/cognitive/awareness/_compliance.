## Overview

The Lucas Awareness Protocol is a fallback and adaptive access-tier engine designed to protect users and prevent unauthorized access in recovery situations. It prioritizes safety, contextual awareness, and user adaptability through symbolic intelligence. This document outlines its compliance alignment with EU regulations and ethical safety mandates.

## 🛡️ Security Goals

* Secure access recovery for users without biometrics or full device access
* Context-aware tier assignment (Restricted → Full)
* Symbolic trace logging for auditability
* Modular fallback integration (voice, LiDAR, gestures)

| Requirement              | Compliance Action                                                                |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Risk-based Tiered Access | Confidence score determines fallback access level (Restricted → Full)            |
| Human Oversight          | All decisions logged; access escalations require user confirmation               |
| Data Minimization        | Only essential biometric/contextual data used, deleted post-auth (configurable)  |
| Logging & Transparency   | Logs include confidence score, context vector, timestamp                         |
| Explainability           | `_generate_context_vector()` and `_calculate_confidence()` ensure decision trace |
| Right to Be Forgotten    | All symbolic trace logs and context inputs deletable via Lucas\_ID console       |
| Security by Design       | Modular architecture, no hardcoded thresholds, adaptive learning optional        |

## 🔁 Recovery Scenarios Covered

1. User loses access to device but can verify via trusted location + voice
2. LiDAR/gesture fallback initiated without password
3. Device mismatch triggers symbolic context challenge
4. Recovery tier limited (e.g., email access only, not transactions)

## 🔬 Red Teaming Requirements (Pending)

* Simulated attacks: spoofed voice, geolocation masking, fake gestures
* Testing fallback abuse (looping attempts)
* Replay resistance evaluation
* Stress testing under edge-case sensor drift

## 🧠 Symbolic Features

* Context vector includes memory-derived biometric scores
* Adaptive confidence thresholds possible (learns per user)
* Seamless integration with `symbolic_trace.jsonl`

## 📍 Next Steps

* [ ] Red Team Protocol design (with `red_team_framework.md`)
* [ ] Full symbolic trace audit of fallback scenarios
* [ ] User-facing fallback tier explainer (in multilingual format)
* [ ] Optional ethical disclosure overlay for Lucas interface
* [ ] Visual logs for researcher/admin dashboards

## 🔒 Licensing and Audit Targets

* EU AI Act High Risk Category: Tier II
* Licensing for Digital Identity Interface (EUID)
* Audit-ready by Q3 2025 (Red Team & Compliance Digest)
* Alignment with ISO/IEC 27001, 27701, and ENISA guidelines
