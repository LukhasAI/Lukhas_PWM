## 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE
The architectural design of the **Knowledge Module** is grounded in principles that promote clarity, efficiency, and adaptability. At its core lies the **symbolic knowledge integration framework**, which serves as the foundational layer for data processing. This framework enables LUKHAS AGI to interpret and manipulate symbols representing knowledge in ways that mirror human cognitive processes.

The module interacts with other LUKHAS components via well-defined API interfaces that facilitate data exchange. Using standard protocols such as RESTful APIs ensures compatibility with various systems and services, allowing for seamless integration into broader applications. Within this architecture, a modular design philosophy enables each feature to operate independently while contributing to a cohesive whole.

The integration of machine learning models enhances the module's ability to learn from user interactions and external data feeds. This dynamic learning loop allows for continuous improvement in performance and understanding—creating a system that evolves alongside its user base.

## 💻 USAGE EXAMPLES
### Simple Usage
To harness the power of the **Knowledge Module**, you can initiate a basic query as follows:

```python
from lukhas.config.knowledge.symbolic_knowledge_integration import KnowledgeModule

# Instantiate the Knowledge Module
knowledge_module = KnowledgeModule()

# Query for information
response = knowledge_module.query("What is quantum consciousness?")
print(response)
```
This code snippet demonstrates how to access knowledge seamlessly through a simple query interface, showcasing how intuitive it is to engage with LUKHAS AGI.

### Advanced Usage
For those seeking deeper integration, consider utilizing contextual awareness features:

```python
# Advanced querying with contextual input
context = {
    "user_location": "California",
    "previous_queries": ["What is quantum physics?", "Explain consciousness."]
}

response = knowledge_module.contextual_query("How does quantum physics relate to consciousness?", context)
print(response)
```
In this example, we see how context enriches responses, allowing LUKHAS AGI to provide insights tailored to previous interactions and user circumstances.
