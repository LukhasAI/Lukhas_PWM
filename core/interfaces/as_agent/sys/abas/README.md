# 🧠 ABAS · Adaptive Behavioral Arbitration System

ABAS is the emotional guardian module of LUCΛS. It evaluates system readiness, cognitive load, and stress thresholds before allowing message delivery or symbolic interaction.

---

## 🧬 Purpose

ABAS ensures that no symbolic delivery occurs when the emotional environment is unstable, the system is overloaded, or symbolic misalignment is detected.

It functions as a soft “conscience layer” — guiding symbolic decisions based on internal affective feedback.

---

## 📦 Module Components

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `abas.py` | Main arbitration logic — invoked before all NIAS/DAST interactions |

---

## 🔐 Integration Points

ABAS is called by:
- `nias_core.py` → blocks message delivery if stress too high
- `inject_message_simulator.py` → prints arbitration reason
- `feedback_loop.py` → feeds long-term tuning signals to ABAS
- `dast_core.py` (future) → partner arbitration / emotion sync

---

## ⚙️ Logic Summary

ABAS evaluates incoming payloads using:

- `emotion_vector`: current joy, calm, stress, longing
- `user_tier`: required access level
- `time_delta`: recency of prior symbolic delivery
- `feedback history`: symbolic score trends

---

## 🧭 Possible Outcomes

| Outcome | Symbol | Meaning |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Allow   | ✅     | Delivery is emotionally safe and consented |
| Defer   | 🌙     | Stress or imbalance → message rerouted to dream |
| Block   | 🔒     | Delivery not permitted — high risk or mismatch |

---

## 🛠 Future Directions

- 🪞 Emotional memory trace history
- 📉 Cooldown pacing between payloads
- 🌀 Symbolic stress decay or recovery models
- 🗣️ Partner voice arbitration + tone matching
