# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# FILENAME: onboarding.py
# VERSION: 1.0.0
# TIER SYSTEM: Tier assignment is a key part of onboarding; specific endpoints might enforce tier prerequisites.
# ΛTRACE INTEGRATION: ENABLED
# CAPABILITIES: Defines stubbed API endpoints for user onboarding stages like start, tier setup,
#               consent collection, and completion.
# FUNCTIONS: start_onboarding_endpoint, setup_user_tier_endpoint, collect_user_consent_endpoint,
#            complete_onboarding_process_endpoint.
# CLASSES: None.
# DECORATORS: @onboarding_bp.route (Flask Blueprint).
# DEPENDENCIES: Flask (Blueprint, request, jsonify), logging, time.
# INTERFACES: Exposes HTTP endpoints under /api/v2/auth/onboarding (once Blueprint is registered).
# ERROR HANDLING: Currently returns 501 Not Implemented for all stubbed logic.
# LOGGING: ΛTRACE_ENABLED for request receipt and stub warnings.
# AUTHENTICATION: Onboarding often precedes full authentication but may involve temporary session/token management.
# HOW TO USE:
#   Register `onboarding_bp` with the main Flask application.
#   Endpoints will then be accessible, e.g., POST /api/v2/auth/onboarding/start.
# INTEGRATION NOTES: This module provides routes for the initial user onboarding sequence.
#                    Actual logic needs to be implemented by integrating with user management,
#                    tier management, consent management, and ΛiD generation services.
# MAINTENANCE: Implement the TODO sections with robust onboarding logic.
#              Ensure secure handling of user data throughout the onboarding process.
