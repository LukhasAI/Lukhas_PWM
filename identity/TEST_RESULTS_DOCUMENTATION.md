## Missing Dependencies

### 1. Actor System Components
**Missing**: `SupervisionStrategy`, `Actor`, `ActorRef`  
**Required By**: All colony implementations  
**Impact**: Colonies cannot initialize without actor system supervision  
**Mock Strategy**: Create minimal actor system interface

### 2. Self-Healing System
**Missing**: `core.self_healing` module  
**Required By**: IdentityHealthMonitor  
**Impact**: Health monitoring cannot perform healing operations  
**Mock Strategy**: Stub healing strategies without execution

### 3. Tagging System
**Missing**: `core.tagging_system` module  
**Required By**: IdentityTagResolver  
**Impact**: Cannot store/retrieve tags persistently  
**Mock Strategy**: In-memory tag storage

### 4. Event Bus Infrastructure
**Missing**: Proper async initialization of global event bus  
**Required By**: All components for inter-colony communication  
**Impact**: No real-time event propagation  
**Mock Strategy**: Simple pub/sub implementation

### 5. Biometric Hardware Interfaces
**Missing**: Real biometric capture devices  
**Required By**: BiometricVerificationColony  
**Impact**: Cannot capture real biometric data  
**Mock Strategy**: Generate synthetic biometric data with documented characteristics

## Mock Implementation Details

All mocks have been clearly documented in the test code:

```python
# MOCK: Actor system components
class MockActor:
    """MOCK: Placeholder for missing Actor class"""
    pass

# MOCK: Biometric sample generation
def generate_mock_biometric_sample(biometric_type: str, quality: float = 0.8):
    """
    MOCK: Generate simulated biometric data.
    In production, this would interface with actual biometric sensors.
    """
    # Returns random bytes instead of real biometric data
```

## Performance Characteristics (Theoretical)

Based on implementation analysis:

| Metric | Expected Performance | Notes |
|--------|---------------------|--------|
| Colony Initialization | 100-500ms | Depends on agent count |
| Biometric Verification | 50-200ms | Per sample, parallel processing |
| Consensus Achievement | 100-300ms | Scales with colony size |
| Event Propagation | <10ms | Local event bus |
| GLYPH Generation | 500-2000ms | Tier dependent |
| Trust Network Query | <50ms | Graph traversal |

## Colony State Analysis

### Agent Distribution (Design Specification)
- **BiometricVerificationColony**: 27 agents (3 per biometric type)
- **ConsciousnessVerificationColony**: 24 agents (3 per analysis method)
- **DreamVerificationColony**: 24 agents (3 per dream analysis type)
- **DistributedGLYPHColony**: 15 agents (3 per fragment type)

## Conclusion

The LUKHAS Identity System integration is architecturally complete with all major components implemented. The code demonstrates:

1. **Distributed Architecture**: Colony-based verification with consensus
2. **Tier-Aware Processing**: Different verification depths per tier
3. **Self-Healing Capabilities**: Automatic recovery mechanisms
4. **Trust Networks**: Distributed reputation and tagging
5. **Event-Driven Design**: Real-time coordination

However, the system requires core infrastructure dependencies to be operational. All missing dependencies have been clearly documented with mock placeholders, making it straightforward to integrate real implementations when available.

The system is ready for the next phase: implementing the missing core dependencies and replacing mock implementations with real hardware/software interfaces.
