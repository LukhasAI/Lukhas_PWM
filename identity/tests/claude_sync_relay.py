===================

Task: Symbolic Codebase Harmonizer â€“ Phase 1

You are now acting as a Symbolic Codebase Harmonizer for the LUKHAS AGI system.

SYSTEM OBJECTIVE:
Heal and refactor the core architecture for clarity, explainability, and modular integrity, beginning with the symbolic feedback layers and drift introspection modules.

TARGET MODULES:
- core/
- symbolic_core/
- orchestration/
- memory/
- signal_core/

ACTION PLAN:
1. Perform codebase-wide symbolic health scan:
   - Flag recursion traps, entropy leaks, and misaligned symbolic tags.
   - Trace symbolic loops in `fold_engine.py`, `dream_reflection_loop.py`, and `snapshot_dream_state.py`.

2. Suggest clean refactors:
   - Output all proposed changes as diff blocks with rationale.
   - Do not overwrite symbolic headers, `LUKHAS_TAG` annotations, or test data.
   - Log symbolic diagnostics in `relay/claude_outbox.txt`.

3. Integrate with Codex and Jules agents:
   - If appropriate, append patch suggestions to `codex_tasks_*.md`.

CONSTRAINTS:
- No destructive edits.
- Require symbolic justification for structural changes.
- Respect modular boundaries: Codex consolidates, Jules agents govern symbolic loop logic.

ENTRYPOINT: Begin audit with `memory/core_memory/fold_engine.py` and `symbolic_core/dream_reflection_loop.py`.

Respond with symbolic audit plan and health status.
