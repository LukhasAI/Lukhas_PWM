LUKHAS Authentication System Test Suite

This module provides comprehensive testing infrastructure for the LUKHAS Authentication System,
covering unit tests, integration tests, performance benchmarks, and security validation.

The test suite validates:
- Core authentication mechanisms and quantum consciousness integration
- Constitutional AI gatekeeper functionality and ethical compliance
- Multi-device synchronization and cross-platform compatibility
- Cultural profile management and adaptive UI responses
- Quantum entropy generation and cryptographic security
- Real-time WebSocket communication and visualization systems
- Mobile QR code animation and biometric integration
- Attention monitoring and cognitive load estimation
- Audit logging and compliance tracking

Test Categories:
- Unit Tests: Individual component validation
- Integration Tests: Cross-module interaction verification
- Performance Tests: Latency, throughput, and resource usage benchmarks
- Security Tests: Cryptographic strength and vulnerability assessment
- UI/UX Tests: Interface responsiveness and accessibility validation
- Compliance Tests: Regulatory and ethical standard verification

Hidden Treasures Tested:
- AGI Consciousness Engine integration points
- Brain-computer interface compatibility
- Emergency override system activation
- Dream engine state transitions
- Steganographic QR encoding validation
- Neural network activation pattern analysis
