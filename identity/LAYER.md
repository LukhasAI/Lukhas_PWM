# Identity Layer

## ✅ Purpose
The Identity layer implements the tiered safety system, access control, authentication, and audit logging. It ensures all agents and operations are properly authorized and tracked for security and compliance.

## ✅ What it can depend on
- `core/`: Base utilities and interfaces
- `memory/`: For storing identity and audit data
- External security libraries (cryptography, jwt, etc.)

## ❌ What must never import from it
- `core/`: Core is foundational and must not depend on identity
- `memory/`: Memory is a lower-level service
- Any high-level application layers should access through proper interfaces

## 🔄 Lifecycle events / triggers
- **Authentication**: Verify agent/user identity on connection
- **Authorization**: Check permissions for each operation
- **Audit Logging**: Record all significant actions
- **Tier Assignment**: Evaluate and assign safety tiers
- **Access Revocation**: Emergency shutdown of compromised identities

## 🏗️ Key Components
- `tiered_access.py`: Multi-tier safety and access control system
- `authentication.py`: Identity verification and token management
- `authorization.py`: Permission checking and role management
- `audit_logger.py`: Comprehensive audit trail system
- `safety_monitor.py`: Real-time safety constraint enforcement
- `threat_detector.py`: Anomaly detection and threat identification

## 🎯 Design Principles
1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security checks
2. **Fail Secure**: Default to denying access when uncertain
3. **Audit Everything**: Complete trail of all operations
4. **Performance**: Security checks must not significantly impact latency
5. **Tier Isolation**: Higher tiers have progressively stricter controls

## 🏛️ Tiered System
1. **Tier 0 (Public)**: Basic read-only access
2. **Tier 1 (Authenticated)**: Standard agent operations
3. **Tier 2 (Privileged)**: Advanced features and learning
4. **Tier 3 (Administrative)**: System configuration and management
5. **Tier 4 (Emergency)**: Break-glass access for critical situations

## 🔁 Cross-layer Interactions
- Used by ALL layers for access control
- Provides authentication tokens to `api` layer
- Monitors `consciousness` and `learning` for safety violations
- Works with `orchestration` to enforce access policies
