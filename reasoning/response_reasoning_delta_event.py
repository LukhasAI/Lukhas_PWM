# If `_models.BaseModel` is part of a core LUKHAS framework library, an absolute import
# (e.g., `from core_framework.core.models import BaseModel`) would be more robust.

# LUKHAS AI - Response Reasoning Delta Event Model
#
# Module: reasoning.response_reasoning_delta_event
# Version: 1.1.0 (Standardization Pass)
# Function: Defines the data structure for events representing partial updates
#           to reasoning content during response generation.
# Origin: Auto-generated by Stainless from an OpenAPI specification (as per original header).
#
# Integration: This model is likely used by LUKHAS components that stream or
#              progressively reveal reasoning steps or outputs to a client or
#              another internal service. It relies on a `BaseModel` typically
#              provided by a Pydantic-like library within the LUKHAS framework.
