# LUKHAS AI - Response Reasoning Item Model
#
# Module: reasoning.response_reasoning_item
# Version: 1.1.0 (Standardization Pass)
# Function: Defines data structures for individual reasoning items and their summaries,
#           likely used in constructing detailed explanations for AI responses.
# Origin: Auto-generated by Stainless from an OpenAPI specification (as per original header).
#
# Integration: These models are part of a larger system for generating and
#              communicating reasoning steps. They depend on `BaseModel` from the
#              LUKHAS framework's core models.
