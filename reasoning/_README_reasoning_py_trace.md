## reasoning/reasoning.py

### Purpose
This module implements a `SymbolicEngine` class intended for cognitive-level symbolic reasoning within the LUKHAS v1_AGI. Its goal is to establish relationships between concepts, events, and actions using pure symbolic methods, focusing on explainability, reliability, and ethical alignment. The comments within the file note its similarity to other reasoning files like `symbolic_reasoning.py` and `reasoning_engine.py`, suggesting potential overlap or versioning.

### Current Status (as of July 2024 Standardization Pass)
- Not modified during the July 2024 standardization pass due to persistent integration issues with automated refactoring tools (diff application failures for this specific file).
- The original structure uses Python's standard `logging` module for ΛTRACE logging.
- The file defines a `SymbolicEngine` class with methods for extracting semantic content, symbolic patterns, logical elements, building logical chains, and calculating confidences.
- It includes placeholder or simplified logic for several complex reasoning steps (e.g., semantic overlap, confidence heuristics).
- An `_update_metrics` method is called but not defined within the class.
- A `_format_result_for_core` method is referenced in a footer comment but not implemented in the class body.

### Planned Refactoring (TODO)
The following changes were intended but not applied due to tool issues:

1.  **Standardize Logging to `structlog`**:
    *   Replace all `logging` imports and calls with `structlog`.
    *   Ensure all log calls use `structlog`'s key-value pair format.
    *   Update child logger creation (e.g., `self.logger = logger.getChild(...)`) to use `structlog`'s `bind()` or equivalent.

2.  **Update Headers and Footers**:
    *   Apply the latest standardized LUKHAS AI file header.
    *   Add the standard LUKHAS AI file footer with audit and metadata.

3.  **Refine ΛTRACE Messages**:
    *   Ensure all log messages are structured, informative, and provide relevant context as key-value pairs.

4.  **Enhance Docstrings and Comments**:
    *   Review and improve all docstrings and comments for clarity, completeness, and consistency with LUKHAS standards. Document the purpose and I/O of each method.

5.  **Improve Type Hinting**:
    *   Add or refine type hints for all function and method signatures and internal variables. Replace `Dict` with `Dict[str, Any]` or more specific types. Add `-> None` for `__init__`.

6.  **Standardize Timestamps**:
    *   Replace `datetime.now()` with `datetime.utcnow()` for generating timestamps to ensure UTC consistency, especially in `reasoning_timestamp` and request IDs.

7.  **Variable Names and Logic Review**:
    *   Standardize variable names for clarity (e.g., `req_id` to `request_id`, `semantic_content` to `semantic_content_text`).
    *   Clarify the logic and purpose of methods like `_identify_primary_conclusion` which currently seems to return a structure type rather than a conclusion string.
    *   Add a stub implementation for the undefined `_update_metrics` method, including logging.
    *   Remove or implement the `_format_result_for_core` method if it's intended to be part of the class.

8.  **File-Top Comment**:
    *   Add a brief, high-level human-readable comment at the very top of the file, just below the LUKHAS header, summarizing its primary role.

### Next Steps for this File
This file requires manual intervention or a more robust refactoring approach. Key areas for attention include standardizing logging to `structlog`, ensuring all generated timestamps are UTC, and fully implementing or stubbing out all called methods like `_update_metrics`. The potential redundancy with other reasoning modules should also be investigated to consider consolidation.
