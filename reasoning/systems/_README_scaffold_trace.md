## scaffold_lukhas_modules_reasoning_engine.py

### Purpose
This script generates new LUKHAS reasoning module scaffolds. It predates the symbolic refactor and structlog standardization.

### Current Status
- Not modified during the July 2024 standardization pass due to persistent integration issues with automated refactoring tools (diff application failures).
- Original structure assumes procedural code generation and uses standard Python `logging` or `print` statements within its generated templates.

### TODO
- Refactor the template generation logic within `scaffold_lukhas_modules_reasoning_engine.py` to ensure that all scaffolded module files it creates will:
    - Use `structlog` for all ΛTRACE logging.
    - Include standardized LUKHAS AI headers and footers.
    - Incorporate placeholders for tier-based access decorators (`@lukhas_tier_required(level=...)`).
    - Adhere to current docstring and commenting conventions.
- Wrap all generated scaffold functions/classes with appropriate tier-based access placeholders and ΛTRACE headers where applicable.
- Ensure the scaffolder itself uses `structlog` for its own operational logging.

### Suggested Replacement/Refinement Approach
- Modify the string templates within the scaffolder.
- Instead of direct `print()` or `logging.getLogger()` calls in the template strings, use f-string formatting that can be easily injected with:
    - `import structlog`
    - `logger = structlog.get_logger(...)`
    - Standard LUKHAS header and footer blocks.
    - Tier placeholder comments or decorators.
    - Audit metadata footers (`# Last audited: YYYY-MM-DD | by: AgentName`).

This approach will ensure that newly scaffolded modules are compliant with current LUKHAS AI system standards from their inception.
