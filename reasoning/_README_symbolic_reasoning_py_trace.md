## reasoning/symbolic_reasoning.py

### Purpose
This module implements a `SymbolicEngine` class for performing symbolic reasoning within the LUKHAS AGI system. Its described capabilities include extracting symbolic patterns from text, building logical chains from these patterns and other inputs (semantic, contextual), and calculating confidence scores for these chains. The engine is designed with explainability, reliability, and ethical alignment in mind. The file header itself notes its similarity to `enhanced_bot_primary.py` and implies it's an extracted/enhanced version, and it also shares significant structural and naming similarities with `reasoning.py` and `reasoning_engine.py`.

### Current Status (as of July 2024 Standardization Pass)
- Not modified during the July 2024 standardization pass due to persistent integration issues with automated refactoring tools (diff application failures for this specific file).
- The original structure uses Python's standard `logging` module for its ΛTRACE logging.
- The `SymbolicEngine` class defines methods for the reasoning pipeline: `_extract_semantic_content`, `_extract_symbolic_patterns`, `_extract_logical_elements`, `_build_symbolic_logical_chains`, `_calculate_symbolic_confidences`.
- It includes internal data structures for a `reasoning_graph` and `reasoning_history`, though their update logic within the main `reason` method was not explicitly shown in the provided snippet (unlike in `reasoning.py`). It does call `self._update_history` which was not defined in the snippet.
- The file references `self.logic_operators` which are defined.
- It relies on `self.symbolic_rules` for pattern matching.

### Planned Refactoring (TODO)
The following changes were intended but not applied due to tool limitations:

1.  **Standardize Logging to `structlog`**:
    *   Replace all `logging` imports and calls with `structlog`.
    *   Convert all log messages to `structlog`'s key-value pair format.
    *   Update child logger instantiation (e.g., `self.logger = logger.getChild(...)`) to `structlog`'s `bind()` or equivalent.

2.  **Update Headers and Footers**:
    *   Implement the standard LUKHAS AI file header.
    *   Append the standard LUKHAS AI file footer with audit and metadata.

3.  **Refine ΛTRACE Messages**:
    *   Ensure all ΛTRACE messages are structured, clear, and provide useful context as key-value pairs.

4.  **Enhance Docstrings and Comments**:
    *   Review and augment existing docstrings and comments for clarity, completeness, and consistency.

5.  **Improve Type Hinting**:
    *   Add or refine type hints for all function/method signatures and key internal variables. For example, `config: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None` in `__init__`, and `Callable` for `logic_operators` values. Add `-> None` for `__init__`.

6.  **Standardize Timestamps**:
    *   Modify all `datetime.now()` calls to `datetime.utcnow()` (or `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`) for explicit UTC timestamps.

7.  **Method Definitions & Calls**:
    *   The `reason` method calls `self._update_history` but this method was not defined in the provided snippet. A stub or full implementation would be needed.
    *   Similarly, `_update_metrics` was called in other similar files but its presence and definition here would need to be confirmed/added.
    *   The file structure regarding `reasoning_graph` updates in the main `reason` method seems less complete than in `reasoning.py`. This would need review.

8.  **File-Top Comment**:
    *   Add a brief, high-level human-readable comment at the beginning of the file (after the header) summarizing the module's core purpose and noting its relationship to other similar reasoning files.

### Next Steps for this File
This file requires manual refactoring. Key actions include migrating to `structlog`, standardizing headers/footers, ensuring UTC timestamps, and resolving any undefined method calls (like `_update_history`). A crucial step would be to compare this file's `SymbolicEngine` with those in `reasoning.py` and `reasoning_engine.py` to determine if they can be consolidated or if their differences justify separate modules. If they are distinct, their specific roles need to be clearly documented.
