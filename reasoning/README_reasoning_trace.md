# LUKHAS Reasoning Module: Symbolic Trace & Cognitive Flow

Version: 0.1 (Draft)
Last Updated: $(date -I)
Maintainer: Jules-07

## üåê Directory Purpose

The `reasoning/` directory encapsulates the core cognitive functions related to logical inference, abstract problem-solving, causal analysis, and symbolic manipulation within the LUKHAS AGI system. It houses modules that enable the system to:

*   Understand cause-and-effect relationships (`causal_reasoning.py`).
*   Perform abstract reasoning and pattern recognition (`abstract_reasoning_demo.py`).
*   Engage in ethical considerations (`ethical_reasoning_system.py` - *Note: This file was not found during the initial scan, but is listed as a capability. To be verified.*).
*   Execute general symbolic reasoning processes (`symbolic_reasoning.py`, `LBot_reasoning_processed.py`).
*   Manage and define reasoning effort and outcomes (`reasoning_effort.py`, `chat_completion_reasoning_effort.py` - *Note: These files were not found during the initial scan but seem relevant to the directory's purpose. To be verified.*).
*   Handle various reasoning response structures (e.g., `response_reasoning_delta_event.py`, `response_reasoning_done_event.py`, `response_reasoning_item.py`, `response_reasoning_item_param.py`, `response_reasoning_summary_delta_event.py`, `response_reasoning_summary_done_event.py`).
*   Provide scaffolding for creating new reasoning modules (`scaffold_lukhas_modules_reasoning_engine.py`).

The modules aim to provide a structured approach to thinking, decision-making, and problem-solving, forming a foundational layer for higher-level cognitive tasks.

## Special Note on Auto-Generated Files (`response_reasoning_*.py`)

Many files within the `reasoning/` directory, specifically those prefixed with `response_reasoning_`, appear to be auto-generated based on schema definitions (likely from OpenAPI or similar tools). These files define data structures for API responses related to reasoning tasks.

**Key Characteristics:**

*   **Primary Role:** These files primarily define data models (using Pydantic `BaseModel`) for structuring outputs from reasoning processes.
*   **Import Path:** They often contain imports like `from ..._models import BaseModel`. This suggests a dependency on a shared models directory likely located outside the `reasoning` directory itself, which can sometimes lead to import issues if the Python path isn't correctly configured. This was tagged with `#AIMPORT_TODO` and `#ŒõAUTO_GEN_PATH` in the respective files.
*   **Tagging Strategy:**
    *   `#ŒõNOTE`: Added to module and class docstrings to signify their role in data structuring.
    *   `#AIDENTITY`: Used for fields that are crucial for identifying the type or nature of the reasoning response.
    *   `#ŒõCAUTION`: Applied where there are default values or potential ambiguities in the data structures.

**Example:**

```python
# reasoning/response_reasoning_item.py
# ŒõNOTE: Defines the structure for a reasoning item within an API response.
# ŒõAUTO_GEN_PATH: This file might be auto-generated. The import path needs careful management.

from ..._models import BaseModel # AIMPORT_TODO: Check path for auto-generated models

class ReasoningItem(BaseModel):
    # AIDENTITY: Unique identifier for this reasoning item.
    id: str
    # ... other fields ...
    # ŒõCAUTION: Default value, ensure it aligns with actual reasoning outcomes.
    status: str = "pending"
```

This approach ensures that these auto-generated files are appropriately marked for their purpose and potential maintenance considerations without being overly verbose.

## Self-Test Harness

A self-test harness for the symbolic reasoning system is available in `tests/test_reasoning_self_test_harness.py`. This harness can be used to run a suite of tests against the reasoning engine to ensure its correctness and stability.

## Symbolic Convergence Information
For an overview of how symbolic tags from the `reasoning/` module converge with `memory/` and `learning/`, and for broader symbolic diagnostics, refer to the [JULES10_SYMBOLIC_CONVERGENCE.md](../../docs/diagnostics/JULES10_SYMBOLIC_CONVERGENCE.md) document. This includes analysis of tags like `#ŒõDRIFT_HOOK`, `#AIDENTITY_BRIDGE`, and `#ŒõTEMPORAL_HOOK` as observed in this module by Jules-04 and Jules-07.
