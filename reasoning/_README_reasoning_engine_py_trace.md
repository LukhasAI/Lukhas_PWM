## reasoning/reasoning_engine.py

### Purpose
This module implements a `SymbolicEngine` class, designed for cognitive-level symbolic reasoning within the LUKHAS AGI system. It aims to establish relationships between concepts, events, and actions using symbolic methods, with a focus on explainability, reliability, and ethical alignment. The file's internal comments note its similarity to other reasoning files like `reasoning.py` and `symbolic_reasoning.py`, indicating potential overlap or different evolutionary versions of a similar concept.

### Current Status (as of July 2024 Standardization Pass)
- Not modified during the July 2024 standardization pass due to persistent integration issues with automated refactoring tools (diff application failures for this specific file, consistent with issues for other complex reasoning files).
- The original structure utilizes Python's standard `logging` module for its ΛTRACE logging.
- The `SymbolicEngine` class includes methods for extracting semantic content, identifying symbolic patterns, extracting logical elements from these, building logical chains, and calculating confidence scores for these chains.
- It maintains an internal reasoning graph and a history of reasoning sessions.
- Some methods, like `_update_metrics`, are called within the logic but were not defined in the provided code snippet. Another method, `_extract_symbolic_structure`, was noted in a footer comment but also not defined in the class body.

### Planned Refactoring (TODO)
The following changes were intended but not applied due to tool limitations:

1.  **Standardize Logging to `structlog`**:
    *   Transition all `logging` usage to `structlog`.
    *   Convert all log messages to `structlog`'s key-value pair format for structured logging.
    *   Adapt child logger instantiation (e.g., `self.logger = logger.getChild(...)`) to `structlog`'s `bind()` method or equivalent for contextual logging.

2.  **Update Headers and Footers**:
    *   Implement the standard LUKHAS AI file header.
    *   Append the standard LUKHAS AI file footer, including necessary metadata and audit information.

3.  **Refine ΛTRACE Messages**:
    *   Ensure all ΛTRACE messages are structured, clear, and provide useful context as key-value pairs suitable for `structlog`.

4.  **Enhance Docstrings and Comments**:
    *   Review and augment existing docstrings and comments to ensure they are comprehensive, clear, and align with LUKHAS documentation standards. This includes clarifying the purpose, arguments, and return values for all methods.

5.  **Improve Type Hinting**:
    *   Add or refine type hints for all function/method signatures and key internal variables (e.g., `config: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None` in `__init__`, `-> None` for `__init__`). Replace general types like `Any` or `Dict` with more specific types where feasible.

6.  **Standardize Timestamps**:
    *   Modify all `datetime.now()` calls to `datetime.utcnow()` (or `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`) to ensure all generated timestamps are explicitly UTC and consistent across the system.

7.  **Variable Names and Logic Review**:
    *   Review variable names for clarity and consistency with LUKHAS naming conventions (e.g., `req_id` to `request_id`).
    *   Address undefined methods:
        *   Provide a stub implementation for `_update_metrics`, including appropriate logging.
        *   Decide whether `_extract_symbolic_structure` (mentioned in original footer comments but not implemented) should be added as a stub or if the reference is obsolete.

8.  **File-Top Comment**:
    *   Add a brief, high-level human-readable comment at the beginning of the file (after the header) summarizing the module's core purpose.

### Next Steps for this File
Due to the inability to apply automated patches, this file requires manual refactoring to align with the LUKHAS AI standardization goals. The focus should be on implementing `structlog`, standardizing headers/footers, ensuring UTC timestamps, and addressing the undefined methods. The potential redundancy with other symbolic reasoning files should also be investigated as part of a broader architectural review of the `reasoning` package.
