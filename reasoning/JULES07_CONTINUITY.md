# 🧠 Jules-07 Continuity Tracker

This file records symbolic continuity insights, overlap points, and refactor suggestions discovered during the processing of the `reasoning/` directory.

## 🔁 Redundancy Notes

- `causal_reasoning_module.py` duplicates logic seen in `causal_reasoning.py` and `causal_reasoning_engine.py`.
  - Marked with: `# ΛLEGACY`
  - Recommendation: Merge or refactor to avoid logic drift.

## 📌 Incomplete or Stub Modules

- `causal_reasoning_engine.py`
  - Contains placeholder methods.
  - Marked with `# ΛCAUTION`
  - Should be reviewed before symbolic reasoning is finalized.

## 🔎 Cross-Module Symbolic Patterns

- Detected symbolic node loops that may overlap with `brain/` or `consciousness/`.
- Recommend coordination with Jules-09 for `GLYPH_MAP` updates and symbolic_mediator consistency.

## ✨ Suggestions

- Create consolidated core module for causal reasoning.
- Consider aligning all reasoning modules to a symbolic flowchart pattern (see dream_seed loop styles).
