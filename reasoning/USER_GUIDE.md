## Introduction

The LUKHAS Reasoning module transforms raw information into understanding through four fundamental capabilities:

- **Symbolic Logic**: Process formal reasoning with mathematical precision
- **Causal Understanding**: Trace cause-and-effect relationships
- **Abstract Thinking**: Discover patterns that transcend specific instances
- **Adaptive Reasoning**: Switch between deductive, inductive, and abductive modes

Think of it as having a brilliant logician, a detective, a philosopher, and a strategist all working together to solve your problems.

## Getting Started

### Basic Setup

```python
from lukhas.reasoning import ReasoningEngine
from lukhas.reasoning.config import ReasoningConfig

# Initialize with default configuration
reasoner = ReasoningEngine()

# Or with custom configuration
config = ReasoningConfig(
    confidence_threshold=0.85,
    max_inference_depth=10,
    reasoning_style="balanced"  # Options: formal, intuitive, balanced
)
reasoner = ReasoningEngine(config=config)
```

### Your First Reasoning Task

Let's start with a simple logical deduction:

```python
# Define some facts
facts = [
    "All birds have wings",
    "Penguins are birds",
    "Things with wings can potentially fly"
]

# Ask a question
result = reasoner.deduce(
    facts=facts,
    query="Do penguins have wings?"
)

print(f"Answer: {result.answer}")  # Yes
print(f"Confidence: {result.confidence}")  # 0.95
print(f"Reasoning: {result.explanation}")
# Output: "Penguins are birds (given), All birds have wings (given), 
#          Therefore, penguins have wings (modus ponens)"
```

## Core Reasoning Capabilities

### 1. Deductive Reasoning - From General to Specific

When you have general rules and need specific conclusions:

```python
from lukhas.reasoning.inference import DeductiveEngine

deducer = DeductiveEngine()

# Classic syllogism
premises = [
    "All humans are mortal",
    "Socrates is human"
]

conclusion = deducer.deduce(
    premises=premises,
    query="Is Socrates mortal?"
)

# The engine will construct a proof tree showing each logical step
print(conclusion.proof_tree)
"""
1. All humans are mortal (Premise)
2. Socrates is human (Premise)
3. Socrates is mortal (Universal Instantiation: 1,2)
"""
```

### 2. Inductive Reasoning - From Specific to General

When you have examples and need to find patterns:

```python
from lukhas.reasoning.inference import InductiveEngine

inducer = InductiveEngine()

# Observe specific cases
observations = [
    {"swan": 1, "color": "white"},
    {"swan": 2, "color": "white"},
    {"swan": 3, "color": "white"},
    # ... many more white swans
]

# Induce a general rule
generalization = inducer.generalize(
    observations=observations,
    target_property="color"
)

print(f"Hypothesis: {generalization.rule}")
# "All swans are white" (with confidence based on sample size)
print(f"Confidence: {generalization.confidence}")
print(f"Caveat: {generalization.limitations}")
# "Based on 3 observations. May not hold for unobserved cases."
```

### 3. Abductive Reasoning - Finding Best Explanations

When you need to explain observations:

```python
from lukhas.reasoning.inference import AbductiveEngine

abducer = AbductiveEngine()

# Present observations
observations = [
    "The grass is wet",
    "The sprinkler was off last night"
]

# Generate explanations
explanations = abducer.explain(
    observations=observations,
    context="morning backyard inspection"
)

for exp in explanations.ranked_hypotheses:
    print(f"Hypothesis: {exp.description}")
    print(f"Probability: {exp.probability}")
# 1. "It rained" (0.7)
# 2. "Morning dew formed" (0.2)
# 3. "Neighbor's sprinkler oversprayed" (0.1)
```

## Symbolic Reasoning

The symbolic reasoning engine processes logical statements and patterns:

### Pattern Extraction

```python
from lukhas.reasoning.symbolic_reasoning import SymbolicEngine

symbolic = SymbolicEngine(confidence_threshold=0.8)

# Analyze text for logical patterns
text = """
Because the temperature dropped below freezing, the water turned to ice.
This caused the pipes to burst, which resulted in flooding.
"""

patterns = symbolic.reason({
    "text": text,
    "context": {"domain": "physical_causation"}
})

# The engine identifies causal chains
for chain in patterns["valid_logical_chains"].values():
    print(f"Chain: {chain['chain_summary']}")
    print(f"Confidence: {chain['confidence_score']}")
# Output: "Causation: (temperature drop) leads to (ice formation) leads to (pipe burst)"
```

### Working with Concept Knowledge

The module includes a rich concept graph for semantic reasoning:

```python
# Access the concept knowledge base
from lukhas.reasoning.knowledge import ConceptKnowledge

concepts = ConceptKnowledge.load()

# Find related concepts
related = concepts.get_related("consciousness")
print(related)  # ["awareness", "self-awareness", "cognition", "experience", "qualia"]

# Understand concept definitions
definition = concepts.define("reasoning")
print(f"Reasoning: {definition['definition']}")
print(f"Importance: {definition['importance']}")  # 5.0 (maximum)
print(f"Emotional affect: {definition['affect']}")  # "neutral"
```

## Causal Analysis

Understanding cause and effect is crucial for prediction and intervention:

### Building Causal Models

```python
from lukhas.reasoning.causal_program_inducer import CausalReasoner

causal = CausalReasoner()

# Define a causal system
model = causal.build_model({
    "variables": ["study_time", "understanding", "exam_score", "confidence"],
    "relationships": [
        ("study_time", "understanding", strength=0.8),
        ("understanding", "exam_score", strength=0.9),
        ("understanding", "confidence", strength=0.7),
        ("confidence", "exam_score", strength=0.3)
    ]
})

# Analyze interventions
intervention = causal.intervene(
    model=model,
    action="increase study_time by 2 hours",
    target="exam_score"
)

print(f"Expected improvement: {intervention.effect_size}")
print(f"Confidence interval: {intervention.confidence_interval}")
```

### Counterfactual Reasoning

Explore "what if" scenarios:

```python
# What if I had studied differently?
counterfactual = causal.imagine_alternative(
    actual_scenario={
        "study_time": 3,
        "study_method": "passive_reading",
        "exam_score": 75
    },
    alternative_action="active_recall_practice",
    causal_model=model
)

print(f"Predicted alternative score: {counterfactual.predicted_outcome}")
print(f"Key difference: {counterfactual.critical_factor}")
# "Active recall would have improved understanding by 25%"
```

## Abstract Pattern Recognition

Discover deep patterns across different domains:

### Finding Patterns in Data

```python
from lukhas.reasoning.abstract_reasoning import AbstractReasoner

abstract = AbstractReasoner()

# Present examples
examples = [
    {"input": "cat", "output": "tac"},
    {"input": "dog", "output": "god"},
    {"input": "live", "output": "evil"}
]

pattern = abstract.find_pattern(examples)
print(f"Pattern: {pattern.description}")  # "String reversal"
print(f"Confidence: {pattern.confidence}")  # 1.0

# Apply to new cases
prediction = abstract.apply_pattern(pattern, "hello")
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # "olleh"
```

### Cross-Domain Analogies

```python
from lukhas.reasoning.integration import AnalogyMaker

analogist = AnalogyMaker()

# Find analogies between domains
analogy = analogist.find_analogy(
    source_domain="solar_system",
    target_domain="atom",
    mapping_constraints={
        "structural": True,
        "functional": True,
        "causal": False
    }
)

print("Mappings found:")
for mapping in analogy.correspondences:
    print(f"{mapping.source} → {mapping.target}")
# Sun → Nucleus
# Planets → Electrons
# Gravity → Electromagnetic force
# Orbits → Electron shells
```

## Multi-Modal Integration

Combine different types of reasoning for richer understanding:

```python
from lukhas.reasoning.integration import MultiModalReasoner

integrated = MultiModalReasoner()

# Combine visual, textual, and logical information
result = integrated.reason_across_modalities({
    "visual": {
        "scene": "person holding umbrella in sunshine",
        "confidence": 0.9
    },
    "textual": {
        "caption": "Preparing for unexpected weather",
        "sentiment": "cautious"
    },
    "logical": {
        "rule": "If cautious about weather, then prepared for rain",
        "strength": 0.8
    },
    "contextual": {
        "location": "Seattle",
        "season": "spring"
    }
})

print(f"Integrated understanding: {result.synthesis}")
# "Person is being prudent given Seattle's unpredictable spring weather,
#  using umbrella as precaution despite current sunshine"

print(f"Reasoning coherence: {result.coherence_score}")  # 0.92
```

## Meta-Reasoning

The system can reason about its own reasoning process:

### Strategy Selection

```python
from lukhas.reasoning.meta_reasoning import MetaReasoner

meta = MetaReasoner()

# Let the system choose the best reasoning approach
problem = {
    "type": "complex_decision",
    "data_availability": "limited",
    "time_constraint": "urgent",
    "uncertainty_level": "high"
}

strategy = meta.select_strategy(problem)
print(f"Recommended approach: {strategy.name}")
# "Heuristic-guided abductive reasoning"
print(f"Rationale: {strategy.justification}")
# "Limited data and time constraints favor fast heuristics over exhaustive analysis"
```

### Self-Improvement

```python
# Learn from reasoning outcomes
feedback = meta.learn_from_result(
    problem=problem,
    strategy_used=strategy,
    outcome={
        "success": True,
        "accuracy": 0.85,
        "time_taken": 230  # milliseconds
    }
)

print(f"Learning update: {feedback.insight}")
# "Heuristic approach performed well under pressure. 
#  Increasing weight for similar future scenarios."
```

## Advanced Features

### Quantum Logic Integration

For problems requiring superposition of states:

```python
from lukhas.reasoning.quantum import QuantumLogicReasoner

quantum = QuantumLogicReasoner()

# Reason with uncertain premises
result = quantum.quantum_inference(
    premises=[
        {"statement": "The particle is here", "amplitude": 0.7},
        {"statement": "The particle is there", "amplitude": 0.6}
    ],
    query="Where is the particle?",
    measurement_context="position_basis"
)

print(f"Classical answer: {result.classical_outcome}")
print(f"Quantum signature: {result.quantum_properties}")
```

### Dialectical Synthesis

Resolve contradictions creatively:

```python
from lukhas.reasoning.dialectical import DialecticalReasoner

dialectical = DialecticalReasoner()

synthesis = dialectical.synthesize_contradictions(
    thesis="Change is impossible (Parmenides)",
    antithesis="Everything flows (Heraclitus)",
    context="metaphysics_of_time"
)

print(f"Synthesis: {synthesis.resolution}")
# "Change occurs at the phenomenal level while being underlies as constant"
print(f"New insights: {synthesis.transcends_both}")
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Choose the Right Tool

```python
# For formal proofs
use_deductive_reasoning()

# For pattern discovery
use_inductive_reasoning()

# For explanations
use_abductive_reasoning()

# For predictions
use_causal_reasoning()

# For creative insights
use_abstract_reasoning()
```

### 2. Validate Your Reasoning

```python
from lukhas.reasoning.validation import ReasoningValidator

validator = ReasoningValidator()

# Check for logical consistency
validation = validator.validate(reasoning_result)
if validation.has_contradictions:
    print(f"Warning: {validation.contradictions}")

# Check for biases
bias_check = validator.check_biases(reasoning_result)
if bias_check.detected_biases:
    print(f"Potential biases: {bias_check.biases}")
```

### 3. Handle Uncertainty Gracefully

```python
# Always check confidence levels
if result.confidence < 0.7:
    # Request more data or use probabilistic reasoning
    probabilistic_result = reasoner.reason_probabilistically(
        data=limited_data,
        prior_beliefs=domain_knowledge
    )
```

### 4. Combine Multiple Reasoning Modes

```python
# Start with abduction to generate hypotheses
hypotheses = abductive_engine.generate_hypotheses(observations)

# Use deduction to test implications
implications = deductive_engine.derive_implications(hypotheses)

# Apply induction to refine patterns
refined_patterns = inductive_engine.refine_from_cases(
    implications, 
    new_observations
)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue: Low confidence in conclusions**
```python
# Solution: Provide more context
result = reasoner.deduce(
    facts=facts,
    query=query,
    context={
        "domain": "biology",
        "certainty_required": "high",
        "background_knowledge": domain_ontology
    }
)
```

**Issue: Causal cycles detected**
```python
# Solution: Use temporal ordering
causal_model = CausalReasoner(
    temporal_constraints=True,
    cycle_breaking_strategy="temporal_priority"
)
```

**Issue: Abstract patterns too general**
```python
# Solution: Add constraints
pattern = abstract_reasoner.find_pattern(
    examples=data,
    constraints={
        "max_complexity": 3,
        "require_deterministic": True,
        "domain_specific": "mathematics"
    }
)
```

### Example 1: Medical Diagnosis Reasoning

```python
# Combine multiple reasoning types for diagnosis
symptoms = ["fever", "cough", "fatigue", "loss of taste"]
patient_history = {"recent_travel": False, "vaccinated": True}

# Abductive reasoning for initial hypotheses
hypotheses = medical_reasoner.generate_diagnoses(symptoms)

# Causal reasoning for likelihood
causal_analysis = medical_reasoner.analyze_causal_paths(
    symptoms=symptoms,
    conditions=hypotheses.top_conditions
)

# Deductive reasoning for test recommendations
tests_needed = medical_reasoner.deduce_tests(
    hypotheses=hypotheses,
    causal_factors=causal_analysis
)

print(f"Likely conditions: {hypotheses.ranked_list}")
print(f"Recommended tests: {tests_needed}")
```

### Example 2: Financial Market Analysis

```python
# Pattern recognition in market data
market_patterns = financial_reasoner.analyze_patterns(
    data=market_history,
    timeframe="6_months"
)

# Causal analysis of market factors
causal_factors = financial_reasoner.identify_drivers(
    patterns=market_patterns,
    external_factors=["interest_rates", "inflation", "employment"]
)

# Counterfactual scenarios
scenarios = financial_reasoner.generate_scenarios(
    base_case=current_market,
    interventions=["rate_hike", "stimulus_package"],
    causal_model=causal_factors
)

for scenario in scenarios:
    print(f"Scenario: {scenario.name}")
    print(f"Market impact: {scenario.predicted_change}%")
    print(f"Confidence: {scenario.confidence}")
```

### Example 3: Legal Reasoning

```python
# Analyze legal precedents
precedents = legal_reasoner.find_relevant_cases(
    current_case=case_details,
    jurisdiction="federal"
)

# Build logical argument
argument = legal_reasoner.construct_argument(
    position="defendant",
    precedents=precedents,
    facts=case_facts
)

# Check for logical fallacies
validity = legal_reasoner.validate_argument(argument)
print(f"Argument strength: {validity.score}")
print(f"Potential weaknesses: {validity.vulnerabilities}")
```

### Example 4: Scientific Theory Evaluation

```python
# Evaluate competing theories
theories = [
    "wave_theory_of_light",
    "particle_theory_of_light",
    "wave_particle_duality"
]

evaluation = scientific_reasoner.evaluate_theories(
    theories=theories,
    evidence=experimental_data,
    criteria={
        "explanatory_power": 0.4,
        "predictive_accuracy": 0.3,
        "simplicity": 0.2,
        "coherence": 0.1
    }
)

print(f"Best supported theory: {evaluation.winner}")
print(f"Evidence fit: {evaluation.evidence_scores}")
print(f"Synthesis potential: {evaluation.integration_possibility}")
```

## Performance Tips

### 1. Optimize Reasoning Depth

```python
# Adjust depth based on time constraints
if time_critical:
    reasoner.config.max_inference_depth = 3
    reasoner.config.search_strategy = "greedy"
else:
    reasoner.config.max_inference_depth = 10
    reasoner.config.search_strategy = "exhaustive"
```

### 2. Cache Reasoning Results

```python
from lukhas.reasoning.cache import ReasoningCache

cache = ReasoningCache()
reasoner = ReasoningEngine(cache=cache)

# Repeated similar queries will be faster
result1 = reasoner.deduce(facts, query1)  # First time: 100ms
result2 = reasoner.deduce(facts, query1)  # Cached: 1ms
```

### 3. Parallel Reasoning

```python
from lukhas.reasoning.parallel import ParallelReasoner

parallel = ParallelReasoner(num_workers=4)

# Process multiple queries simultaneously
queries = [query1, query2, query3, query4]
results = parallel.batch_reason(facts, queries)
```

## Integration with Other LUKHAS Modules

### With Memory Module

```python
from lukhas.memory import MemoryFold
from lukhas.reasoning import MemoryAugmentedReasoner

# Use past reasoning experiences
memory = MemoryFold()
augmented = MemoryAugmentedReasoner(memory=memory)

result = augmented.reason_with_experience(
    current_problem=problem,
    similar_past_cases=memory.find_similar(problem),
    learning_rate=0.8
)
```

### With Consciousness Module
