# 📦 LUKHAS Pack-What-Matters (PWM)

**Advanced AI Workspace Management System**

LUKHAS PWM helps you organize, prioritize, and manage what truly matters in your digital workspace. Built on advanced AI foundations, it brings intelligent automation to productivity.

## 🎯 Pack-What-Matters Philosophy

> "If it doesn't directly help you manage your workspace more effectively, it doesn't belong."

PWM focuses on:
- **🧹 Intelligent Decluttering** - Automatically identify and archive what doesn't matter
- **🎯 Priority Management** - Surface what needs your attention most
- **⚡ Workflow Automation** - Streamline repetitive workspace tasks
- **🧠 Smart Organization** - AI-powered file and project categorization
- **📊 Productivity Insights** - Understand your workspace patterns

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install PWM
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure your workspace
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your preferences

# Run PWM
python main.py
```

## 🎛️ Core Features

### **Workspace Intelligence**
- **Smart Categorization**: Automatically organize files by project relevance
- **Declutter Analysis**: Identify unused files, duplicate content, outdated documentation
- **Priority Surfacing**: Highlight files and projects needing immediate attention

### **Productivity Automation**
- **Workflow Templates**: Pre-configured setups for different work patterns
- **Smart Archiving**: Automatically move completed projects to appropriate storage
- **Focus Mode**: Hide distractions, show only current priorities

### **AI-Powered Insights**
- **Usage Analytics**: Track which files and projects you actually use
- **Optimization Suggestions**: Recommendations for improving workspace efficiency
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learn your work habits and adapt accordingly

## 🛡️ Guardian System Integration

Your PWM workspace is now protected by the **Guardian System v1.0.0** - a production-grade ethical governance system cherry-picked from the LUKHAS prototype.

### 🚀 What's Protected

- **Critical Files**: README.md, .git/, configuration files
- **Workspace Integrity**: Prevents accidental mass deletions
- **Productivity Health**: Monitors and suggests workspace optimizations
- **Ethical Oversight**: Multi-layer decision validation for file operations

### 🧪 Quick Test

```bash
python test_governance.py
```

### 🎯 Strategic Value

This isn't just file protection - it's **intelligent workspace management** with:
- Symbolic communication (human-friendly feedback)
- Ethical reflection on workspace decisions
- Emergency protocols for critical situations
- Audit trails for all workspace operations

The governance system represents the **strategic intelligence** that transforms your workspace from a simple file storage into a **protected productivity environment**.

- **Consciousness Protection**: Real-time threat detection and emergency response
- **Ethical Drift Detection**: Monitors moral degradation over time
- **Decision Justification**: Philosophical reasoning for all workspace decisions

### 🧪 Comprehensive Testing

```bash
# Run ultimate comprehensive test suite
python test_comprehensive_governance.py

# Test individual components
python test_enhanced_governance.py
python test_governance.py
```

### 🎯 What Gets Tested

1. **Guardian Reflector**: Ethical reflection and moral reasoning
2. **Enhanced Governance**: Multi-layer security validation
3. **Ethics Framework**: Tier-based consent and compliance
4. **Red Team Protocols**: Adversarial attack simulation
5. **Workspace Protection**: File safety and integrity

### 📊 Testing Architecture
