# 📦 LUKHAS Pack-What-Matters (PWM)

**Advanced AI Workspace Management System**

LUKHAS PWM helps you organize, prioritize, and manage what truly matters in your digital workspace. Built on advanced AI foundations, it brings intelligent automation to productivity.

## 🎯 Pack-What-Matters Philosophy

> "If it doesn't directly help you manage your workspace more effectively, it doesn't belong."

PWM focuses on:
- **🧹 Intelligent Decluttering** - Automatically identify and archive what doesn't matter
- **🎯 Priority Management** - Surface what needs your attention most
- **⚡ Workflow Automation** - Streamline repetitive workspace tasks
- **🧠 Smart Organization** - AI-powered file and project categorization
- **📊 Productivity Insights** - Understand your workspace patterns

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install PWM
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure your workspace
