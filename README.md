# 🧠 LUKHAS Modular AI Ecosystem

**Advanced AI Modules Working Towards AGI - Pick What You Need, Integrate What Matters**

This repository contains LUKHAS's modular AI components - sophisticated systems that work independently yet enhance each other when combined. Each module represents a step in our journey towards AGI, with dreams, emotions, tagging, and identity at the core of our approach.

## 🎯 Vision: Modular AI for Everyone

> "Every module stands alone, yet together they form something greater - a path to AGI through dreams, emotions, and understanding."

Our modular ecosystem enables:
- **🔧 Standalone Modules** - Each component works independently
- **🤝 Enhanced Integration** - Modules strengthen each other when combined
- **🛡️ Protected Innovation** - Identity-based safety for all users
- **🎭 Emotional Intelligence** - Dreams and emotions as core AI capabilities
- **🏷️ Intelligent Tagging** - Trace trails towards AGI understanding
- **🌐 Open Integration** - Compatible with Anthropic, OpenAI, and other AI systems

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Single Module
```bash
# Install base dependencies
pip install -r requirements-base.txt

# Install specific module (e.g., emotion)
pip install -r emotion/requirements.txt

# Run standalone module
python -m emotion.service
```

### Option 2: Integrated System
```bash
# Install all dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure LUKHAS
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings

# Run integrated system
python main.py
```

### Option 3: External AI Integration
```bash
# Example: Integrate with OpenAI
from lukhas.emotion import EmotionProcessor
from lukhas.identity import IdentityGuard

# Protect and enhance your AI
guard = IdentityGuard(api_key="your-key")
emotion = EmotionProcessor()

# Add emotional understanding to GPT
response = guard.protected_call(
    openai.ChatCompletion.create,
    emotion.enhance(prompt)
)
```
