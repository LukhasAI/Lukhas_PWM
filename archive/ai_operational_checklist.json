For example, incorporate a simple speech tone analyzer (if not already present) and combine its output with text sentiment analysis for a more accurate overall sentiment. After integration, perform sentiment_analysis_testing: give the system inputs with mixed emotional signals (e.g., neutral words spoken in an angry tone) and verify it produces a balanced interpretation (it should note the conflict or decide which signal is more genuine). The result should be that the system's understanding of sentiment is richer than any single modality alone."

Extend the system such that at set intervals (e.g., daily or weekly), a hash of critical logs or memory states is published to an external blockchain (for example, by using lukhas/bridge/connectors/blockchain_bridge.py). Implement the mechanism to take a consolidated hash (perhaps of the day's Collapse Hashes or a root of the memory Merkle tree) and send it to a blockchain transaction or a timestamp service. This could be done via a minimal API call to a blockchain network (Bitcoin, Ethereum, or a dedicated anchoring service). After implementing, do blockchain_anchoring_verification: retrieve the transaction or record from the blockchain to ensure the hash matches and the timestamp is correct. This proves that the AI's state at that time is immutably recorded, making long-term tampering detectable."

If, for example, Lukhas AI uses GPU acceleration, measure how many TFLOPs it achieves and compare with the wattage.
