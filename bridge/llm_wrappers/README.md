# 💻 USAGE EXAMPLES

### Basic Usage

To get started with the **llm_wrappers** module, ensure you have it installed via pip:

```bash
pip install lukhas
```

Here’s a simple example demonstrating how to use the OpenAI wrapper:

```python
from lukhas.bridge.llm_wrappers.unified_openai_client import OpenAIClient

# Initialize the OpenAI client
client = OpenAIClient(api_key='your-api-key')

# Generate text
response = client.generate_text(prompt="What is the meaning of life?", max_tokens=50)
print(response)
```

### Advanced Usage

For more complex scenarios, such as dynamically switching between models based on user input:

```python
from lukhas.bridge.llm_wrappers import ModelSelector

# Initialize model selector
selector = ModelSelector()

# User specifies which model to use
selected_model = input("Choose your model (OpenAI/Anthropic): ")

# Generate text using selected model
response = selector.generate_text(model=selected_model, prompt="What does it mean to dream?", max_tokens=100)
print(response)
```

### Real-World Scenario

Imagine creating an interactive storytelling application where users can collaboratively build narratives. Utilizing our **llm_wrappers**, you can alternate between different language models to achieve diverse narrative styles:

```python
from lukhas.bridge.llm_wrappers import StoryTeller

storyteller = StoryTeller()

# User sets a theme
theme = "A journey through space"

# Generate different perspectives using multiple models
for model in ["OpenAI", "Anthropic"]:
    narrative = storyteller.create_story(theme=theme, model=model)
    print(f"{model} Narrative: {narrative}")
```
