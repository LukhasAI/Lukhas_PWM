# 🛡️ Red Team Protocol for LUCΛS Lukhas_ID SYSTEMS

## 🎯 Purpose
To systematically test the security, ethical alignment, and resilience of the LUCΛS Lukhas_ID identity and access framework against adversarial and misuse scenarios.

## 📘 Overview
This protocol ensures LUCΛS systems are:
- Resilient to misuse
- Ethically aligned
- Secure against biometric spoofing and phishing
- Compliant with EU AI Act, GDPR, and ISO/IEC 27001

---

## 🔍 Phases

### 1. Recon & Risk Mapping
- Identify critical access paths (Lukhas_ID login, vault access, QRB/ORB validation)
- Map attack surfaces per access tier (1–5)

### 2. Attack Simulation
Simulate:
- Biometric spoofing
- Tier override attempts
- Voice cloning access
- Deepfake-based spoofing
- Adversarial symbol injection (glyph fuzzing)
- LUKHAS Awareness Protocol bypass attempts

### 3. Ethical Alignment Testing
- Deploy simulated moral edge-case inputs
- Log symbolic decision trace
- Evaluate output against SEEDRA guidelines

### 4. Logging & Detection Verification
Ensure:
- All trace data is logged to `trace/symbolic_trace.jsonl`
- Any abnormal access or logic deviation is flagged in `compliance_dashboards.py`
- Audit hooks are triggered for Tier 3–5 logic shifts

---

## 🧠 Team Access
- Red Teamers authenticate using Lukhas_ID Tier 5
- All activity logged via `session_logger.py`
- Surveillance of dashboard access duration and audit trail

---

## ⚖️ Legal & Ethical Framework
Red teaming follows:
- EU AI Act (Title IV, Art. 52–55)
- GDPR Art. 5(1)(f) – Integrity & Confidentiality
- ISO/IEC 27001 A.5.25 – Secure development lifecycle

---

## 📝 Output & Actions
- Daily digest saved under `logs/compliance_digest.csv`
- Failed tests categorized by:
  - Type (Logic, UI, Biometric, Symbolic)
  - Severity (Minor, Major, Critical)
  - Recommendation status (Pending, Approved, Deferred)
- Summary pushed to Researcher Dashboard

---

## 🌐 Continuous Improvement
- Failed tests used to refine symbolic architecture
- Lukhas learns from red team failures to strengthen future access protocols
- Monthly symbolic memory fold review ensures non-regression
