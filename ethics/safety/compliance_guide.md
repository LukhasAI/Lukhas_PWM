# 🛡️ LUKHAS_AGI_3.8 Compliance Guide

This guide provides detailed documentation of **compliance frameworks**, **monitoring mechanisms**, and **regulatory alignment** for LUKHAS_AGI_3.8.

---

## 1. Regulatory Alignment

LUKHAS_AGI_3.8 adheres to the following major regulatory frameworks:

- **EU AI Act (2024/1689)**:
  - Articles 4 (AI Literacy), 5 (Prohibited Practices), 13 (Transparency & Explainability), 15 (Robustness & Accuracy).
- **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**:
  - Articles 5-32 (Data handling, consent, rights of data subjects).
- **OECD AI Principles**:
  - Human-centered values, transparency, robustness, and accountability.
- **ISO/IEC 27001**:
  - Information security management systems (ISMS).

---

### 🗺️ Jurisdiction Hierarchy (Policy Manager Flow)

LUKHAS_AGI_3.8 applies a **jurisdiction-aware policy hierarchy** using the following regulatory precedence:

1. **EU AI Act (2024/1689)**:  
   - Takes **top precedence** for deployments within the EU jurisdiction.
   - Enforced articles include AI Literacy (4), Prohibited Practices (5), Transparency (13), Robustness (15).

2. **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**:  
   - Applies to all **data handling and privacy** aspects globally for EU citizens.

3. **OECD AI Principles**:  
   - Applied globally where local jurisdiction lacks specific AI laws.

4. **ISO/IEC 27001**:  
   - Enforced for **information security management** (ISMS) across all regions.

5. **Local/National Laws**:  
   - Applied **when stricter** or more specific than higher-tier frameworks.

#### Conflict Resolution

- **Stricter rule prevails** (e.g., GDPR overrides less strict national laws).
- In case of regulatory ambiguity:
  - **Default to the higher-tier framework**.
  - **Log the conflict** via the `audit_logger.py`.

#### Monitoring Implementation
- **Policy Manager (`policy_manager.py`)** dynamically:
  - Identifies deployment location.
  - Applies **location-based law stacking**.
  - Adjusts **compliance hooks** accordingly.

## 2. Compliance Components

| **Subsystem**                  | **Compliance Focus**                                            |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Policy Manager**              | Regulation hierarchy by user/deployment location.              |
| **Compliance Drift Monitor**    | Tracks alignment, detects drift across entropy, ethics, and risk.|
| **Audit Logger**                | Logs compliance events and regulatory triggers.                |
| **Risk Management Hooks**       | Mitigates risks (oscillation extremes, entropy surges).        |
| **Lukhas_ID**                    | GDPR-compliant encryption, consent governance, traceability.   |

---

## 3. Monitoring Processes

- **Compliance Drift Monitoring**:
  - Entropy levels (target: 1.2 - 2.5).
  - Ethics drift scores (target: ≤ 0.5 drift index).
  - Active regulation alignment logged per session.

- **Audit Logging**:
  - Events stored in:
    - `logs/compliance/compliance_log_YYYY_MM_DD.json`
    - `lukhas_governance/reports/YYYY-MM-DD/`

---

## 4. Reporting & Visualization

- **Compliance Reports**:
  - Generated in `lukhas_governance/reports/YYYY-MM-DD/`
  - Includes:
    - `compliance_summary.md`
    - `compliance_summary_plot.png`

- **Drift Scores & Entropy Metrics**:
  - Visualized via symbolic folding plots or regulation heatmaps.

---

## 5. Ethical Governance

- **Prohibited AI Practices Avoided**:
  - Social scoring, subliminal manipulation, unauthorized emotion detection (per EU AI Act Article 5).
- **Ethics Engine** ensures arbitration aligned with:
  - **Human agency**, **non-maleficence**, and **transparency**.

---

## 6. AI Literacy Commitment

LUKHAS_AGI_3.8 provides ongoing **AI literacy integration**:
- Internal training systems (future roadmap).
- Symbolic explainability layers for user trust.
