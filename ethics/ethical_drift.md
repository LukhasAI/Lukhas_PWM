# ‚öñÔ∏è LUKHAS Tutorial: Ethical Drift

## Topic: Understanding and Calculating Ethical Drift Scores

This tutorial delves into the concept of "ethical drift" ‚Äî how the perceived ethical alignment of a symbol or concept can shift over time or across contexts.

### Output (Simplified)

**LUKHAS Response:**

‚ÄúEthical drift is the symbolic echo of evolving values.‚Äù

**Understanding Ethical Drift:**

Ethical drift refers to the change in the ethical implications or connotations of a symbol, action, or concept. This drift can be influenced by new information, societal shifts, or the specific context in which the symbol is used.

**Simplified Drift Score Logic (Conceptual):**

1.  **Baseline Ethical Vector (BEV):** Each core symbol has a baseline ethical vector established from foundational texts and principles (e.g., values like compassion, fairness, transparency).
2.  **Contextual Modifiers (CM):** The current query or context introduces modifiers. For example, using the symbol "surveillance" in a "security" context vs. a "privacy" context will apply different modifiers.
3.  **Drift Calculation:** `DriftScore = BEV * CM_Factor + TemporalShift_Factor`
    *   `CM_Factor`: How much the current context pulls the symbol away from its baseline.
    *   `TemporalShift_Factor`: A small, continuous factor representing societal evolution of values.

üìà **Intermediate Note:** High drift scores might indicate a symbol is being used in a potentially problematic or ethically ambiguous way, triggering a need for clarification or more careful alignment filtering.

### Exercise (Conceptual)

How might the ethical drift score of the concept "automation" change when discussed in the context of "job creation" versus "job displacement"?
