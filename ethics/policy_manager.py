📦 MODULE      : policy_manager.py
🧾 DESCRIPTION : Manages compliance hierarchy for LUKHAS_AGI_3. Ensures legal frameworks
                 across jurisdictions (EU AI Act, GDPR, CCPA, OECD, ISO) are respected.
⚖️ COMPLIANCE : Follows local, supranational, and Lukhas governance standards.
"""

# Precedence:
# 1. EU AI Act / NIST (depending on region)
# 2. GDPR / CCPA

# 4. ISO/IEC 27001

# ==============================================================================
# 🔍 USAGE GUIDE (for policy_manager.py)
#
# 1. This module helps LUKHAS_AGI_3 dynamically select and log applicable
#    legal frameworks based on deployment location (EU, US, Global).
#
# 2. Example Usage (Python CLI):
#
#    >>> from Λ_governance.policy_manager import determine_active_regulations, log_active_regulations
#    >>> from core_governance.policy_manager import determine_active_regulations, log_active_regulations
#    >>> determine_active_regulations("EU")
#    ['EU AI Act', 'GDPR', 'ISO/IEC 27001', 'Lukhas Governance Policies']
#
#    >>> log_active_regulations("oscillator", "EU")
#    [oscillator] Active Regulations for EU: EU AI Act, GDPR, ISO/IEC 27001, Lukhas Governance Policies
#
# 3. CLI Command for Test (Linux/Mac):
#
#    python3 -c "from Λ_governance.policy_manager import determine_active_regulations; print(determine_active_regulations('EU'))"
#    python3 -c "from core_governance.policy_manager import determine_active_regulations; print(determine_active_regulations('EU'))"
#
# 💡 DEV TIPS:
# - Use `log_active_regulations()` to integrate into compliance hooks.
# - The hierarchy ensures stricter regulations take precedence (EU AI Act > GDPR > OECD).
