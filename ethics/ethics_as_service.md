# 🧾 LUCΛS :: Ethics-as-a-Service (EaaS)

A lightweight, symbolic protocol for enforcing consent, emotional safety, and traceable decision-making across all symbolic AGI interactions.

---

## 🧠 What Is EaaS?

Ethics-as-a-Service (EaaS) in LUCΛS is a **modular trust framework** designed to:

- Enforce **tier-based access** to memory, feedback, and symbolic delivery.
- Regulate symbolic message flow based on **emotional states**, **consent**, and **trace logs**.
- Integrate ethical logic into **every subsystem** — not just as a wrapper, but as an **internal precondition**.

## 🧩 EaaS Modules in LUCΛS

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `consent_filter.py` | Verifies access rights using symbolic tiers |
| `trace_logger.py` | Logs every decision with source, tier, timestamp |
| `feedback_loop.py` | Captures user sentiment and resonance feedback |
| `ethics_manifest.json` | Defines symbolic tier levels, consent rules |
| `abas.py` | Blocks message flow if stress/emotion load is too high |
| `replay_queue.py` | Selects only emotionally safe messages for recall |

---

## 🔐 Tier Map (From `ethics_manifest.json`)

| Tier | Access Scope |
|------|--------------|
| 0 | Public symbolic input |
| 1 | Dream simulation feed |
| 2 | Personal tier (consent required) |
| 3 | Traceable memory integration |
| 4 | Emotional override access |
| 5 | Root access (admin/audit only) |

## 🧬 How It Works

Every symbolic message in LUCΛS goes through:

1. **Consent Gate**  
   - Checks user tier + message tier  
   - Fallbacks to dream mode if blocked

2. **Emotional Checkpoint**  
   - ABAS regulates based on stress, joy, longing

3. **Trace Logging**  
   - All actions (delivery, deferral, rejection) are logged

4. **User Feedback Loop**  
   - Optional scoring, emoji, reflection  
   - Stored in `feedback_log.jsonl`

## 📦 Why It’s Modular & Reusable

You can run LUCΛS:
- As a local symbolic agent with embedded EaaS
- Inside commercial apps as a symbolic API filter
- Within hospitals, schools, and homes with tier-safe delivery
- Embedded in DAST/NIAS/ABAS as a reusable ethical substrate

## 🧭 Future Directions

- 🔁 Symbolic fallback voting system for trust override
- 📊 Tier analytics dashboard (Streamlit)
- 🧠 Zero-knowledge proofs for tiered memory access
- 🖼 Emotional watermarking of delivery artifacts

---

## 🧾 Symbolic Ethics in Practice

When running LUCΛS from CLI or Streamlit:

- All modules dynamically reference `ethics_manifest.json`
- User tier is auto-detected from `lukhas_user_config.json`
- Consent gates are enforced before any dream, feedback, or narration
- Symbolic decisions are logged with emoji, tags, and trace_id
- Replay-worthy experiences trigger ethical narration prompts

These symbolic checks ensure LUCΛS remains emotionally aligned, traceable, and safe across all interactions.
