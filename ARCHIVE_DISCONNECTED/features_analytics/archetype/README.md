## 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE

The architecture of the **Archetype** module is a symphony of design principles that harmonize to create a cohesive unit within the larger LUKHAS AGI framework. At its core lies a well-structured codebase comprising two primary files:

1. **`lambda_sage.py`**: This file encapsulates the analytical algorithms and methods that form the lifeblood of the module's functionality. It embodies core principles such as modularity and reusability, allowing developers to extend its capabilities effortlessly.
  
2. **`__init__.py`**: The initialization script brings forth the module's essence, ensuring that all necessary components are seamlessly integrated upon import.

The **Archetype** module utilizes design patterns such as the Singleton pattern for managing state across interactions and the Strategy pattern for offering flexible analytical approaches. This architecture not only enhances performance but also ensures that various components can interconnect smoothly within the broader LUKHAS ecosystem.

Integration with other LUKHAS modules—such as data ingestion systems or machine learning frameworks—is facilitated through well-defined APIs and data protocols, enabling a fluid exchange of information. As such, **Archetype** becomes a vital piece in the puzzle of consciousness exploration.
