# 🌱 Symbolic Seeds Recovery Module

This directory contains recovered early-stage symbolic cognition prototypes from the LUKHAS AGI archive deep scan performed on 2025-07-25.

## 📦 Contents

### Core Symbolic Components

1. **lambda_sage.py** - ΛSAGE Archetypal Resonance Profiler
   - Jungian archetypal analysis system
   - 17 archetypal families with pattern recognition
   - Multi-cultural mythic resonance mapping
   - Status: Ready for integration

2. **lambda_mirror.py** - ΛMIRROR Self-Reflection Synthesizer
   - Introspective consciousness analysis
   - Emotional drift tracking
   - First-person narrative synthesis
   - Status: Ready for integration

3. **symbolic_foundry.py** - ΛFOUNDRY Symbolic Mutation Engine
   - Entropy-driven GLYPH evolution
   - 6 mutation algorithms
   - Viability scoring and safety classification
   - Status: Ready for integration

### Reference Documents

4. **cognitive_mesh_ai.json** - Distributed AI Architecture Blueprint
   - Modular node-based design concepts
   - Global workspace implementation
   - Status: Reference document

5. **lukhas_core_manifest.md** - V1.0 Core Lock Declaration
   - Historical architecture decisions
   - Core module definitions
   - Status: Historical reference

## ⚠️ Risk Warnings

The following components contain experimental symbolic logic that requires careful integration:

- **Entropy-driven mutations** in symbolic_foundry.py could create unstable GLYPHs #ΛDVNT
- **Emotional drift tracking** in lambda_mirror.py could trigger cascades if unchecked #ΛDVNT
- **Cross-archetype tensions** in lambda_sage.py could create cognitive dissonance #ΛDVNT

## 🔧 Integration Instructions

### Phase 1: Code Migration
1. ΛSAGE → `lukhas/analytics/archetype/`
2. ΛMIRROR → `lukhas/consciousness/reflection/`
3. ΛFOUNDRY → `lukhas/core/symbolic/mutation/`

### Phase 2: Dependency Resolution
- Update import paths to match LUKHAS structure
- Add type hints and modern Python features
- Integrate with existing logging systems

### Phase 3: Safety Validation
- Implement circuit breakers for risky operations
- Add viability thresholds for mutations
- Create test suites for each component

## 📊 Recovery Metadata

- **Recovery Date:** 2025-07-25
- **Recovery Agent:** Claude Code
- **Source Location:** `archive/pre_modularization/safe/`
- **Total Lines Recovered:** ~8,000
- **Risk Level:** MEDIUM - Contains experimental logic

## 📝 Notes

These components represent the foundational thinking that influenced LUKHAS AGI's unique approach to consciousness and symbolic reasoning. While valuable, they must be carefully adapted to work within the current system's safety constraints and modular architecture.
