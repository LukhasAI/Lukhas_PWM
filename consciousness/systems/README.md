# core_consciousness

This directory contains the core components of the LUKHAS consciousness system.

## Audit Recommendations (Jules-05, 2024-07-27)

Based on a symbolic trace audit, it is recommended that a dedicated glossary and a symbolic flowchart be created for this directory.

*   **Glossary:** The concepts exported by this package (e.g., `ConsciousnessIntegrator`, `ConsciousnessState`, `ConsciousnessEvent`) are highly abstract and fundamental to the AGI's architecture. A glossary would provide clear, concise definitions for these concepts, improving developer understanding and onboarding.

*   **Symbolic Flowchart:** While the main `AGENT_FLOW_MAP.md` provides a high-level overview, a more detailed flowchart specifically for the `core_consciousness` module would be beneficial. This flowchart should illustrate how the `ConsciousnessIntegrator` interacts with other cognitive components (memory, reasoning, etc.) and how `ConsciousnessState` is updated in response to `ConsciousnessEvent`s. This would provide a valuable visual aid for understanding the flow of symbolic information through the AGI's "central nervous system."
