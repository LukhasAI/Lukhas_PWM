## Overview

LUKHAS PWM (Pack-What-Matters) is a lean, production-ready AGI system that distills essential LUKHAS components into working, functional modules. It combines consciousness, memory, identity, quantum processing, biological adaptation, and ethical governance to create a sophisticated AI research platform. The codebase achieves 99.9% system connectivity with comprehensive Guardian System protection.

## High-Level Architecture

### System Organization

The codebase follows a modular architecture with 41 root systems organized into functional domains (reduced from 53 through consolidation):

**Core Infrastructure:**
- `core/` - GLYPH engine, symbolic processing, system foundations (396 files)
- `orchestration/` - Brain integration, multi-agent coordination (349 files)
- `governance/` - Guardian System v1.0.0 ethical oversight

**Cognitive Systems:**
- `consciousness/` - Awareness, reflection, decision-making (55 files, 70.9% functional)
- `memory/` - Fold-based memory with causal chains (222 files, 72.1% functional)
- `reasoning/` - Logic, causal inference, goal processing (117 files)
- `identity/` - Quantum-resistant auth, tier access (147 files, 66.0% functional)

**Advanced Processing:**
- `quantum/` - Quantum-inspired algorithms (93 files, 82.8% functional)
- `bio/` - Biological adaptation systems (49 files, 65.3% functional)
- `emotion/` - VAD affect, mood regulation (26 files, 64.7% functional)
- `creativity/` - Dream engine with 40+ modules (89 files)

**Integration:**
- `api/` - FastAPI endpoints (core and commercial APIs)
- `architectures/` - DAST, ABAS, NIAS unified architecture systems
- `bridge/` - External API connections (98 files)
- `ethics/` - Multi-tiered policy engines (17 files)

### Key Design Patterns

1. **Symbolic Communication**: All modules use GLYPH tokens for cross-module messaging
2. **Guardian Protection**: Every operation validated by ethics engine
3. **Fold-Based Memory**: Preserves causal chains and emotional context
4. **Dream-Driven Innovation**: Creative solutions from controlled chaos
5. **Bio-Symbolic Coherence**: 102.22% coherence between biological and symbolic systems

### Module Communication

Critical dependencies:
- All modules depend on `core/` for GLYPH processing
- `orchestration/brain/` coordinates cross-module actions
- `governance/` validates all operations
- `memory/` provides persistence across modules
- Circular dependencies strictly avoided

## Guardian System Integration

The Guardian System v1.0.0 provides comprehensive ethical oversight:

### Protection Features
- **Remediator Agent**: Symbolic immune system for threat detection
- **Reflection Layer**: Ethical reasoning for all operations
- **Symbolic Firewall**: Multi-layered security protection
- **Drift Detection**: Monitors for ethical and behavioral drift
- **Decision Justification**: Philosophical reasoning engine

### Testing with Guardian Reflector
- Multi-framework moral reasoning (virtue ethics, deontological, consequentialist)
- SEEDRA-v3 model for deep ethical analysis
- Real-time consciousness protection
- Comprehensive enterprise-grade validation

## Development Guidelines

### Adding Features

1. **Choose Module**: Select appropriate module based on functionality
2. **Use GLYPHs**: Always use symbolic tokens for cross-module communication
3. **Ethics First**: All features must pass Guardian System validation
4. **Memory Integration**: Significant actions create memory folds
5. **Test Coverage**: Aim for 98%+ coverage (like dream engine)

### Working with Specific Modules

**Memory System (`memory/`)**
- Use fold-based architecture
- Preserve emotional context
- 99.7% cascade prevention rate
- Close memory folds after use

**Quantum Processing (`quantum/`)**
- 82.8% functional - most reliable module
- Post-quantum cryptography ready
- Multi-stage transformation pipelines

**API Module (`api/`)**
- Only 33.3% functional - needs improvement
- FastAPI-based endpoints
- Focus on stability over features

**Orchestration (`orchestration/`)**
- 60.5% functional - refactoring needed
- Brain hub coordinates all modules
- Avoid tight coupling

### Security Considerations

- All inputs validated through `bridge/`
- Identity module handles authentication
- Ethics engine cannot be bypassed
- Complete audit trail with causality chains
- Quantum-resistant cryptography throughout

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Never bypass Guardian System** - All operations must be validated
2. **Always use GLYPHs** - Direct module communication breaks symbolic unity
3. **Monitor drift scores** - Respond to behavioral changes
4. **Close memory folds** - Prevent memory leaks
5. **Check functional status** - Some modules only partially operational

## Debugging Tips

1. **Check Trace Logs**: `trace/` directory for system-wide debugging
2. **Monitor Drift**: Watch `drift_score` in governance metrics
3. **Memory Visualization**: Use fold visualizers for memory debugging
4. **Ethics Violations**: Check Guardian System logs
5. **GLYPH Translation**: Use symbolic parser for token debugging
6. **Functional Analysis**: Run `PWM_FUNCTIONAL_ANALYSIS.py` for module status

## Production Deployment

The system includes 3 microservice deployments:
- Consciousness Platform (`deployments/consciousness_platform/`)
- Dream Commerce (`deployments/dream_commerce/`)
- Memory Services (`deployments/memory_services/`)

Each service is Docker-containerized with FastAPI endpoints.

## File Organization Guidelines

**IMPORTANT**: When creating new files, follow the proper directory structure to maintain a clean root directory.

### File Placement Rules

**NEVER create these in root:**
- Analysis scripts (PWM_*.py) → Place in `tools/analysis/`
- Test files (test_*.py) → Place in appropriate `tests/` subdirectory
- Reports (*.json, *_REPORT.md) → Place in `docs/reports/`
- Planning documents → Place in `docs/planning/`
- Temporary or working files → Use appropriate module directory

**Examples:**
- ❌ `/PWM_FUNCTIONAL_ANALYSIS.py` 
- ✅ `/tools/analysis/PWM_FUNCTIONAL_ANALYSIS.py`

- ❌ `/test_governance.py`
- ✅ `/tests/governance/test_governance.py`

- ❌ `/PWM_OPERATIONAL_STATUS_REPORT.md`
- ✅ `/docs/reports/status/PWM_OPERATIONAL_STATUS_REPORT.md`

### When Creating New Components

1. **Analysis Tools**: Always place in `tools/analysis/` or `tools/scripts/`
2. **Documentation**: Use `docs/` with appropriate subdirectory
3. **Tests**: Place in `tests/` with module-specific subdirectory
4. **Module Code**: Use the appropriate module directory
5. **Configuration**: Only core configs belong in root

### Automated Organization

A pre-commit hook and GitHub Action help maintain organization:
- Files created in wrong locations will be flagged
- Suggestions provided for correct placement
- Automatic organization can be triggered

Remember: A clean root directory makes the project more professional and easier to navigate!

## Cross-Repository Development

When working with LUKHAS AI components:

### Source Repository Guidelines
- **Prototype Repository**: Primary source for innovative features and experimental code
  - Check `/Users/agi_dev/Prototype/` for original implementations
  - Safe to copy logic and patterns (created by LUKHAS AI founder)
  - Be aware of naming/path differences when adapting code

### Integration Workflow
1. **Research in Prototype**: Look for relevant implementations and patterns
2. **Adapt for PWM**: Modify to fit Pack-What-Matters philosophy
3. **Test Integration**: Ensure compatibility with existing PWM systems
4. **Document Origins**: Note source files when bringing in new components

### Key Differences to Note
- **Prototype**: Includes experimental and visionary components
- **PWM**: Only production-ready, essential components
- **Paths**: May differ between repositories
- **Dependencies**: PWM uses minimal dependencies

When in doubt about a component's implementation, check the Prototype repository for the original LUKHAS AI vision and adapt it to PWM's lean requirements.
