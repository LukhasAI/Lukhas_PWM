## Applying Mitochondrial Concepts to LUKHAS_AGI

Based on the workspace code and research paper, here are key areas where mitochondrial concepts could enhance your AGI system:

### 1. Quantum-Inspired Attention Mechanism

The `QuantumInspiredAttention` class in 03_05_25_neuro_symbolic_engine_.py could be enhanced with mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) principles:

```python
class QuantumInspiredAttention:
    # ...existing code...
    
    def _apply_superposition(self, attention_distribution: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
        """Apply quantum-inspired superposition to the attention distribution with ETC efficiency"""
        # Apply original superposition
        result = np.dot(self.superposition_matrix, attention_distribution)
        
        # Apply tunnel-inspired probability adjustment
        tunnel_coefficients = np.exp(-self.barrier_height * np.abs(attention_distribution))
        tunnel_adjusted = result * tunnel_coefficients
        
        # Normalize to maintain probability distribution
        return tunnel_adjusted / np.sum(tunnel_adjusted) if np.sum(tunnel_adjusted) > 0 else tunnel_adjusted
    
    def _initialize_barrier_height(self):
        """Initialize probabilistic exploration barrier height parameter"""
        self.barrier_height = 0.75  # Configurable barrier coefficient
```

### 2. Proton Gradient-Inspired Resource Allocation

In 27_04_23_upgraded_lucas_oscillator.py, implement a proton gradient-inspired energy buffer for the `LucasAGI` class:

```python
class LucasAGI:
    # ...existing code...
    
    def __init__(self, prime_ratios=(3,5,7,11)):
        # ...existing initialization...
        self.energy_buffer = {
            'high_priority': 0.0,  # Storage for critical tasks
            'medium_priority': 0.0,  # Storage for standard tasks
            'low_priority': 0.0,  # Storage for background tasks
        }
        self.max_buffer_capacity = 1.0
        self.buffer_decay_rate = 0.05
    
    def allocate_computation_resources(self, tasks):
        """Allocate computational resources using quantum-tunneling inspired algorithm"""
        # Sort tasks by priority
        prioritized_tasks = sorted(tasks, key=lambda t: t['priority'], reverse=True)
        
        # Calculate tunneling probabilities
        def tunneling_probability(task):
            complexity = task.get('complexity', 0.5)
            priority = task.get('priority', 0.5)
            return np.exp(-complexity * (1.0 - priority))
            
        # Allocate resources based on tunneling probabilities
        return [task for task in prioritized_tasks 
                if tunneling_probability(task) > self.system_health.get('barrier_threshold', 0.3)]
    
    def update_energy_buffers(self, current_load):
        """Update energy buffers based on system load, inspired by mitochondrial proton gradients"""
        # During low-load periods, store energy in buffers
        if current_load < 0.3:  # Low load
            free_capacity = self.max_buffer_capacity - self.energy_buffer['high_priority']
            self.energy_buffer['high_priority'] += min(0.1, free_capacity)
        
        # Apply natural decay to simulate proton leak
        for buffer in self.energy_buffer:
            self.energy_buffer[buffer] *= (1.0 - self.buffer_decay_rate)
```

### 3. Fusion/Fission-Inspired Network Resilience

Implement a mitochondrial fusion/fission-inspired module for resilient network operation:

```python
class SelfHealingNetwork:
    """Implements mitochondrial fusion/fission inspired resilience for neural networks"""
    
    def __init__(self, graph_structure):
        self.graph = graph_structure
        self.health_metrics = {}
        self.fusion_threshold = 0.3  # Threshold for underutilization
        self.fission_threshold = 0.8  # Threshold for corruption/overload
    
    def assess_node_health(self):
        """Assess health of all nodes in the network"""
        for node_id in self.graph.nodes:
            # Metrics could include: utilization rate, error rate, energy efficiency
            utilization = self.graph.nodes[node_id].get('utilization', 0.5)
            error_rate = self.graph.nodes[node_id].get('error_rate', 0.1)
            self.health_metrics[node_id] = {
                'utilization': utilization,
                'error_rate': error_rate,
                'health_score': utilization * (1.0 - error_rate)
            }
    
    def perform_fusion_fission(self):
        """Perform fusion for underutilized nodes and fission for corrupted nodes"""
        # Identify candidates for fusion (underutilized nodes)
        fusion_candidates = [node_id for node_id, metrics in self.health_metrics.items() 
                            if metrics['utilization'] < self.fusion_threshold]
        
        # Identify candidates for fission (corrupted or overloaded nodes)
        fission_candidates = [node_id for node_id, metrics in self.health_metrics.items() 
                             if metrics['error_rate'] > self.fission_threshold]
        
        # Perform fusion operations
        for i in range(0, len(fusion_candidates), 2):
            if i+1 < len(fusion_candidates):
                self._merge_nodes(fusion_candidates[i], fusion_candidates[i+1])
        
        # Perform fission operations
        for node_id in fission_candidates:
            self._split_node(node_id)
    
    def _merge_nodes(self, node_a, node_b):
        """Merge two underutilized nodes, combining their functions"""
        # Implementation would depend on your specific graph structure
        pass
    
    def _split_node(self, node_id):
        """Split an overloaded or corrupted node into separate components"""
        # Implementation would depend on your specific graph structure
        pass
```

### 4. Resonance Synchronization for Ethical Decision-Making

Enhance the ethical framework with resonance-based consensus:

```python
class QuantumEthicalHandler:
    """Quantum-enhanced decision-making with constitutional safeguards"""
    # ...existing code...
    
    def measure_ethical_state(self, context, weights):
        """Use resonance synchronization for ethical decision making"""
        # Calculate phase alignment between subsystems (Vivox vs. Oxintus)
        vivox_phase = self._calculate_phase(context, 'vivox')
        oxintus_phase = self._calculate_phase(context, 'oxintus')
        
        # Measure phase alignment (closer to 0 means better alignment)
        phase_diff = abs(vivox_phase - oxintus_phase)
        
        # Apply resonance correction if misalignment is detected
        if phase_diff > 0.3:  # Threshold for acceptable misalignment
            self._apply_resonance_correction(vivox_phase, oxintus_phase)
            
        # Proceed with ethical decision after alignment
        # ...existing decision logic...
    
    def _calculate_phase(self, context, subsystem):
        """Calculate the phase of a subsystem based on its current state"""
        # Implementation depends on your specific subsystem design
        pass
    
    def _apply_resonance_correction(self, vivox_phase, oxintus_phase):
        """Apply correction to bring subsystems into resonance"""
        # Implementation would adjust subsystem parameters to improve alignment
        pass
```

### 5. Uncoupling Protein-Inspired Stress Response

Add an uncoupling protein-inspired stress response system:

```python
class LucasAGI:
    # ...existing code...
    
    def monitor_post_market(self):
        # ...existing code...
        
        # Check for system stress indicators
        if self.system_health.get('compliance_strain', 0) > 0.7:
            self._activate_stress_decoupling()
        
    def _activate_stress_decoupling(self):
        """Activate stress response inspired by mitochondrial uncoupling proteins"""
        logging.info("Activating stress decoupling protocol")
        
        # Identify non-essential processes that can be temporarily suspended
        non_essential_processes = self._identify_non_essential_processes()
        
        # Generate temporary decoupling keys for controlled shutdown
        decoupling_keys = {process: self._generate_decoupling_key() for process in non_essential_processes}
        
        # Apply decoupling to reduce system stress
        for process, key in decoupling_keys.items():
            self._decouple_process(process, key)
            
        logging.info(f"Decoupled {len(decoupling_keys)} non-essential processes")
        self.system_health['compliance_strain'] *= 0.6  # Reduce strain
```

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Start with Resource Allocation**: Begin by implementing the probabilistic exploration-inspired resource allocator, as it provides immediate efficiency benefits.

2. **Phased Integration**: Add the resonance synchronization for ethical decision-making in a second phase, after thorough testing.

3. **Testing Framework**: Develop specific benchmarks that measure:
   - Energy efficiency (FLOPs/watt)
   - Decision stability under stress conditions
   - Recovery time from simulated failures

4. **Ethical Considerations**: Ensure the energy optimization doesn't compromise ethical safeguards by maintaining the MAE (Moral Arbitration Engine) layer oversight.

These enhancements would elevate your LUKHAS_AGI system by incorporating biomimetic principles that have been optimized through billions of years of evolution, potentially leading to a more efficient, resilient, and adaptable AGI architecture.

            }
    
    def perform_fusion_fission(self):
        """Perform fusion for underutilized nodes and fission for corrupted nodes"""

        # Apply tunnel-inspired probability adjustment
        tunnel_coefficients = np.exp(-self.barrier_height * np.abs(attention_distribution))
        tunnel_adjusted = result * tunnel_coefficients
        
        # Normalize to maintain probability distribution
        return tunnel_adjusted / np.sum(tunnel_adjusted) if np.sum(tunnel_adjusted) > 0 else tunnel_adjusted
