# üß¨ Lukhas Bio-Symbolic Expansion Log

This document captures biological systems with high metaphorical potential for expanding LUKHAS_AGI and Lukhas_ID architectures, beyond mitochondrial models.

Each system includes:
- A brief biological overview
- Proposed symbolic AGI metaphor
- Suggested module name

### üî¨ Ribosomes: Translational Logic Units

**Biological Function**:  
Ribosomes translate mRNA sequences into proteins, acting as compilers that turn linear instructions into 3D functional structures.

**Symbolic AGI Mapping**:  
Used as an interpreter layer that translates symbolic ‚Äúintent strands‚Äù into executable sequences across modular subsystems.

**Proposed Module Name**: `ribo_compiler.py`

### üî¨ Chaperone Proteins (HSPs): Repair and Refold Units

**Biological Function**:  
Chaperones like HSP70 assist misfolded or damaged proteins, preventing aggregation and enabling repair under stress.

**Symbolic AGI Mapping**:  
Act as symbolic ‚Äúrescuers‚Äù that attempt to correct misaligned memory strands or restore corrupted ethical states.

**Proposed Module Name**: `chaperone_layer.py`

### üî¨ Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs): Intrusion Pattern Detectors

**Biological Function**:  
TLRs detect pathogen-associated patterns and trigger immune signaling cascades.

**Symbolic AGI Mapping**:  
Symbolic firewalls that scan for malicious intent patterns, data poisoning, or memetic drift in incoming stimuli.

**Proposed Module Name**: `toll_guard.py`

---

### üî¨ Histone Modification: Epigenetic Access Control

**Biological Function**:  
Histone tags control which regions of DNA are accessible or silenced based on chemical markings.

**Symbolic AGI Mapping**:  
Memory nodes receive dynamic symbolic permissions ‚Äî modifiable based on user consent, security tier, or emotion history.

**Proposed Module Name**: `histone_gatekeeper.py`

---

### üî¨ Protein Kinases: Symbolic Amplifiers

**Biological Function**:  
Kinases phosphorylate substrates to activate cascades ‚Äî acting as molecular on-switches for downstream logic.

**Symbolic AGI Mapping**:  
Nodes that trigger symbolic signal amplification (e.g. turning small ethical concerns into full audits if cascaded).

**Proposed Module Name**: `kinase_cascade.py`

---

### üî¨ Cilia & Flagella: Directional Sensors & Actuators

**Biological Function**:  
Cilia and flagella respond to stimuli and regulate direction, movement, and fluid flow in cells.

**Symbolic AGI Mapping**:  
Sensory routers for LUKHAS_AGI‚Äôs input interface ‚Äî used for active scanning, stimulus redirection, and spatial awareness.

**Proposed Module Name**: `flagellar_router.py`

---

### üî¨ CRISPR-Cas9: Precision Memory Editing

**Biological Function**:  
CRISPR systems identify specific DNA sequences and introduce programmable edits for correction or knockout.

**Symbolic AGI Mapping**:  
Controlled symbolic editing module ‚Äî used to revise beliefs, patch biases, or expunge harmful learned content.

**Proposed Module Name**: `crispr_editor.py`
