## 💻 USAGE EXAMPLES

### Simple Usage Example

Here's how you can utilize the base configuration functionality:

```python
from lukhas.core.common.base_config import Config

# Initialize your configuration
config = Config()
config.load('path/to/config.json')

# Accessing configuration values
print(config.get('model_parameters'))
```

### Advanced Usage Pattern

In this scenario, we demonstrate how to monitor system health dynamically:

```python
from lukhas.core.common.base_health import HealthMonitor

# Create an instance of the health monitor
monitor = HealthMonitor()

# Check system health periodically
while True:
    status = monitor.check_health()
    if not status['healthy']:
        print("Alert: System is unhealthy!", status)
        # Trigger recovery or alerting mechanisms
```

### Real-World Scenario

Imagine deploying LUKHAS AGI in an autonomous vehicle system. By leveraging LUKHAS Common's health monitoring and logging capabilities, developers can ensure that all subsystems are operating optimally while capturing extensive logs for post-deployment analysis.
