# README for core/symbolic/

## Overview

The `core/symbolic/` directory is established as a **future central hub** for the LUKHAS AI system's core symbolic logic, processing capabilities, symbolic constant definitions, and glyph synthesis mechanisms.

Currently, this directory serves as a structural placeholder, anticipating the consolidation and centralization of symbolic functionalities that may presently be distributed across other modules or are yet to be developed. The vision for this module is to foster **`#ΛSYMBOLIC_UNITY`**, creating a coherent and unified framework for all symbolic operations within LUKHAS.

## Symbolic Notes & Conventions

-   **`#ΛSYMBOLIC_UNITY`**: This is the guiding principle for this module. It signifies the goal of unifying symbolic representations, logic, and processing to create a cohesive symbolic layer within LUKHAS.
-   **`#ΛSEED`**: Symbolic processes, especially generative ones (like glyph synthesis or procedural symbolic content creation), may require seed values for deterministic or controlled outputs. Constants or configurations related to such seeds would be housed or referenced here.
-   **`#ΛTRACE`**: All significant symbolic operations, transformations, or generations undertaken by this module will require detailed `structlog` tracing to ensure auditability and understand the flow of symbolic information.
-   **`#ΛCONSTANT`**: Centralized symbolic constants, namespaces, or fundamental symbolic tokens would be defined here.
-   **Headers/Footers**: All Python files must include the LUKHAS standardized header and footer blocks.
-   **Logging**: `structlog` will be the standard for logging.

## Current Status & Future Vision

-   **Current Status (as of Jules-06 initialization)**:
    -   The directory has been created.
    -   `__init__.py` exists as a placeholder, including basic `structlog` initialization and comments outlining the intended future scope. It contains commented-out examples of potential constants and function stubs.
    -   This `README_symbolic.md` file has been created to document the purpose and future direction.

-   **Future Vision & Migration Hub**:
    -   **Symbolic Constants**: Critical symbolic constants currently defined in other modules (e.g., `core/advanced/constants/`, `core/common/` if they have a strong symbolic nature rather than just general utility) may be migrated here for better centralization under the symbolic theme.
    -   **Symbolic Processing Logic**: Algorithms and engines related to parsing, interpreting, transforming, or reasoning with symbolic data will be developed or moved here.
    -   **Glyph Synthesis**: If LUKHAS employs a system for generating visual symbols or "glyphs" based on internal states or data, the logic for this synthesis would ideally reside in `core/symbolic/`.
    -   **Symbolic Knowledge Representation**: Core structures or schemas for representing symbolic knowledge could be defined or managed from this module.
    -   **Interface for Symbolic Operations**: This module will expose clear APIs for other parts of the LUKHAS system to interact with its symbolic capabilities.
-   **Glyph Coordination**: Provides a centralized map (`GLYPH_MAP` in `glyphs.py`) for standardized visual/conceptual glyphs used across the system. See [./README_glyphs.md](./README_glyphs.md) for more details. This initial glyph coordination work is under Jules-06 and is expected to expand, particularly in coordination with Jules-09's `SYMBOLIC_COLLAPSE_MAP.md`.

## Key Conceptual Tags for This Module

-   **`#ΛSYMBOLIC_UNITY`**: The overarching goal.
-   **`#ΛSEED`**: For reproducible or controlled symbolic generation.
-   **`#ΛTRACE`**: For detailed logging of symbolic processes.
-   **`#ΛGLYPH`**: Marks the definition and use of the centralized `GLYPH_MAP` and related utilities.
-   **`#AINTERPRET` / `#ΛREASON`**: (Future) For functions that interpret or reason over symbolic data.

## How to Use (Conceptual Future Usage)

```python
# Conceptual example of future usage
from core.symbolic import core_symbol_parser, generate_dynamic_glyph
from core.symbolic.constants import LUKHAS_CORE_SYMBOL_VOCABULARY

# Parse a raw symbolic input
parsed_symbol = core_symbol_parser.parse(raw_input_data, vocabulary=LUKHAS_CORE_SYMBOL_VOCABULARY)

# Generate a visual glyph based on a system state
current_state = {"mood": "curious", "focus_level": 0.8}
glyph_representation = generate_dynamic_glyph(current_state, style="minimalist")

log.info("Generated glyph for current state", glyph=glyph_representation) # ΛTRACE
```

## Contribution Guidelines

-   When developing new symbolic processing capabilities for the LUKHAS core, consider `core/symbolic/` as the primary candidate location.
-   Prioritize `#ΛSYMBOLIC_UNITY` by designing new functionalities to be compatible and coherent with existing or planned symbolic structures.
-   Ensure all new code adheres to LUKHAS standards, including header/footers, `structlog` logging, and comprehensive ΛTAGging.
-   Propose migration of existing symbolic logic from other modules to this central hub if it aligns with the goal of unification.
-   Update this README and `__init__.py` as the module evolves and new capabilities are added.
