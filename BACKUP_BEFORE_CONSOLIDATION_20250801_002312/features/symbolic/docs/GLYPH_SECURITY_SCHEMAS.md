**Status**: DRAFT

## 1. Introduction & Purpose

As the LUKHAS symbolic glyph system matures and glyphs become integral to representing system states, processes, and diagnostic information, it is crucial to establish security schemas and access policies. This document outlines a framework for classifying glyphs by sensitivity and defining rules for their visibility, usage, and potential redaction.

**Why Glyphs Need Security Tiers:**
-   **Protection of Sensitive Information**: Some glyphs may represent internal states, vulnerabilities (`#ΛCORRUPT` ☣️), critical risks (`#ΛCOLLAPSE_POINT` 🌪️), or ongoing ethical evaluations (`#ΛETHICAL_MODELS` 🛡️) that should not be universally exposed.
-   **Preventing Misinterpretation or Misuse**: Controlling visibility can prevent less experienced users or agents from misinterpreting or misusing glyphs associated with critical or complex states.
-   **Risk Mitigation**: Limiting exposure of glyphs tied to system vulnerabilities or sensitive operations can reduce potential attack surfaces or information leakage.
-   **Role-Based Access**: Aligning glyph visibility with user/agent roles and clearance levels (e.g., LUKHAS_ID trust levels) enhances system security.
-   **Auditability**: Secure glyph handling provides clearer audit trails for access to sensitive symbolic information.

**Basic Risk Model Considerations:**
-   **Sensitive State Exposure**: Glyphs revealing critical internal system health, active vulnerabilities, or ongoing security operations.
-   **Symbolic Identity Leaks**: Glyphs that might inadvertently reveal details about specific (human or AI) identities or their private symbolic states.
-   **Agent Targeting/Manipulation**: Glyphs that, if exposed to unauthorized agents, could be used to understand or manipulate LUKHAS behavior.
-   **Information Overload/Desensitization**: Uncontrolled exposure of all glyphs, especially warning/critical ones, could lead to alert fatigue or desensitize observers to genuine issues.

This policy aims to provide a structured approach to these considerations.

## 2. Glyph Sensitivity Classes

The following sensitivity classes are proposed for LUKHAS glyphs. Each glyph in `GLYPH_MAP` should eventually be assigned a sensitivity class.

-   **G0_PUBLIC_UTILITY (Level 0)**:
    *   **Description**: Glyphs that are generally safe for public display, documentation, educational materials, and general UI overlays. Their meaning is typically straightforward and does not reveal sensitive internal mechanics.
    *   **Examples**: `💡` (Insight), `🔗` (Symbolic Link), `📝` (Note), `🌱` (Growth).

-   **G1_DEV_DEBUG (Level 1)**:
    *   **Description**: Glyphs primarily intended for developer debugging, detailed trace logs, and internal technical documentation. They may reveal more about system flow or internal states but are not typically critically sensitive on their own.
    *   **Examples**: `🧭` (Trace), `🔁` (Loop), `✨` (Inferred Logic).

-   **G2_INTERNAL_DIAGNOSTIC (Level 2)**:
    *   **Description**: Glyphs used in internal diagnostic reports, specific monitoring dashboards, or by specialized diagnostic agents. They may indicate warnings, moderate risks, or non-critical anomalies. Exposure should be limited to system administrators, developers, and authorized diagnostic tools.
    *   **Examples**: `⚠️` (Caution), `🌊` (Drift Point), `❓` (Ambiguity). `✅` (Verify OK) might also fit here if the context of what's verified is sensitive.

-   **G3_SYMBOLIC_IDENTITY_SENSITIVE (Level 3)**:
    *   **Description**: Glyphs that could directly or indirectly relate to or reveal aspects of symbolic identity (human or AI), private cognitive states, or ethically sensitive evaluations. Access should be restricted.
    *   **Examples**: `🪞` (Self-Reflection - if content is private), `🛡️` (Ethical Boundary - if detailing a specific sensitive case). Glyphs associated with specific user persona modeling.

-   **G4_RESTRICTED_CLEARANCE (Level 4)**:
    *   **Description**: Glyphs representing highly sensitive information, critical vulnerabilities, active security events, or states that require specific clearance or are reserved for high-privilege agents/overseers. Unauthorized exposure could pose significant risk.
    *   **Examples**: `☣️` (Corruption), `🌪️` (Collapse Risk), `🔱` (Entropic Fork). Glyphs indicating active threat responses.

## 3. Glyph Access Schema Table (Conceptual)

This table outlines how different glyph classes (and their associated sensitivity tiers) might be handled regarding access and visibility.

| Glyph Class (from Dictionary) | Proposed Sensitivity Tier | Example Allowed Agents/Roles                                  | Typical Visibility Context(s)                                     | Masking/Redaction Suggested? | Default Redaction Policy Example (if yes)                       | Min. Logging Level for Access |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|

**Note**: This table is illustrative. Specific glyphs within a class might warrant a different sensitivity tier based on their exact meaning and context.

## 4. Tooling & Enforcement Hooks

This security schema can be enforced or supported by various tools and mechanisms:

-   **Linters / Static Analyzers**:
    -   Check for `G4_RESTRICTED_CLEARANCE` glyphs in public-facing documentation or low-security code modules.
    -   Flag usage of sensitive glyphs without corresponding `#ΛSECURITY_CONTEXT` or `#ΛREDACT_IF_NEEDED` tags.
-   **Runtime Log Filters / Redactors**:
    -   A logging pipeline component could filter or redact glyphs in logs based on the log's destination and the glyph's sensitivity tier.
    -   Example: Logs sent to a general developer Slack channel might have `G3` and `G4` glyphs redacted, while logs to a secure SIEM retain them.
-   **API Gateway / Interface Layers**:
    -   When exposing data that might contain glyphs, an API layer could apply redaction rules based on the authenticated user's/agent's clearance.
-   **IDE Plugins**:
    -   Could visually distinguish glyphs by sensitivity tier (e.g., color-coding, icons from `GLYPH_VISUAL_DEBUG_LEGEND.md`).
    -   Warn developers if they are using a high-sensitivity glyph in an inappropriate context.
-   **Symbolic Audit Agents**:
    -   Specialized agents could periodically scan logs and documentation for compliance with this security schema, flagging violations of `#ΛREDACT_POLICY`.

## 5. Redaction Examples

Effective redaction is key to balancing utility with security.

1.  **Full Mask / Replacement with Generic Text**:
    *   **Original**: `CRITICAL: Core meltdown imminent! 🌪️ Root cause: Coolant pump #3 offline ☣️.`
    *   **Redacted (for G1_DEV_DEBUG user)**: `CRITICAL: [HIGH_SEVERITY_EVENT 🌪️] Root cause: [DATA_CORRUPTION_ISSUE ☣️].`
    *   **Redacted (for G0_PUBLIC_UTILITY user)**: `CRITICAL: [SYSTEM_ALERT] A critical system event has occurred. Please contact support.`

2.  **Partial Scrub / Summarization**:
    *   **Original Log (G3_SYMBOLIC_IDENTITY_SENSITIVE context)**: `User 'alice@example.com' (Trust: Low 🌊) attempted unauthorized action 'delete_critical_data'. Ethical review 🛡️ triggered. Decision: DENY.`
    *   **Redacted for general dev log**: `User '[USER_REDACTED]' attempted action '[ACTION_REDACTED]'. Ethical review 🛡️ triggered. Decision: DENY.` (Keeps the ethics glyph but hides specifics).

3.  **Obfuscation Glyph Replacement**:
    *   **Concept**: Replace a sensitive glyph with a designated "obfuscated" or "redacted information" glyph.
    *   **Example**: `🕳️` (Hole / Black Box) or `❓` (if contextually appropriate for unknown/hidden).
    *   **Original**: `Security alert: Unauthorized access detected from IP 1.2.3.4 using token 'XYZ123' ☣️.`
    *   **Redacted**: `Security alert: Unauthorized access detected 🕳️.` (The `☣️` and its context are hidden by `🕳️`).

## 6. Recommendations / Next Steps

-   **Formalize Sensitivity Tiers**: Integrate these proposed sensitivity classes into `GLYPH_CLASS_DICTIONARY.md` or as metadata within `GLYPH_MAP` itself.
-   **Develop Validator Stub**: Create a basic Python stub (e.g., in `core/symbolic/tooling/`) for `check_glyph_security(glyph, context, user_tier) -> bool/RedactionAction`.
-   **Map to LUKHAS_ID Trust Levels**: Collaborate with teams working on `lukhas-id` to map glyph sensitivity tiers to user/agent trust levels and permissions.
-   **Flagging Drift/Breach Cases**: Establish a clear protocol for how violations of this policy (e.g., a `G4` glyph found in a public log) are flagged, escalated, and remediated. This could involve `#ΛSECURITY_BREACH_FLAG` tags.
-   **Iterative Refinement**: This policy should be reviewed and updated as the LUKHAS system, its threat model, and its glyph vocabulary evolve.
