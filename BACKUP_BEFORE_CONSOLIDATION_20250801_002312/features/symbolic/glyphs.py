# MODULE: core.symbolic.glyphs
# DESCRIPTION: Defines a centralized map (GLYPH_MAP) of symbolic glyphs to their conceptual meanings
#              within the LUKHAS system. This supports symbolic unity and visual representation.

# ΛNOTE: This module centralizes the mapping of visual glyphs to symbolic concepts.
# ΛSYMBOLIC_UNITY: Aims to provide a unified visual language for LUKHAS concepts.

# ΛCONSTANT
# ΛGLYPH
# ΛNOTE: GLYPH_MAP provides a central registry for symbolic glyphs and their meanings.
#        This map can be used for UI representations, logging enhancements, or symbolic analysis.
#        The selection of glyphs and their meanings should be curated carefully.
# ΛSEED: The initial state of this map can be considered a seed for LUKHAS's visual symbolic language.
#        Future versions or procedural generation of glyphs might use more explicit seeding.

# ΛCONSTANT
# ΛNOTE: Defines the version of the GLYPH_MAP itself. This should align with any
#        related documentation, such as GLYPH_CONFLICT_POLICY.md.

GLYPH_MAP: Dict[str, str] = {
    "☯": "Bifurcation Point / Duality / Choice",  # ΛNOTE: Represents a critical decision point, divergence, or balance of opposing forces.
    "🪞": "Symbolic Self-Reflection / Introspection",  # ΛNOTE: Denotes processes of self-awareness, internal state examination, or meta-cognition.
    "🌪️": "Collapse Risk / High Instability / Chaotic State",  # ΛNOTE: Indicates potential for system instability, symbolic collapse, or unpredictable behavior. Often linked to #ΛCOLLAPSE_POINT.
    "🔁": "Dream Echo Loop / Recursive Feedback / Iterative Refinement",  # ΛNOTE: Symbolizes iterative processes, feedback loops (especially in dreams or learning), or recurring symbolic patterns. Often linked to #ΛDREAM_LOOP.
    "💡": "Insight / Revelation / Novel Idea",  # ΛNOTE: Represents a moment of understanding, a new concept emerging, or a solution found.
    "🔗": "Symbolic Link / Connection / Dependency",  # ΛNOTE: Denotes a significant relationship or dependency between symbolic entities or system components.
    "🛡️": "Safety Constraint / Ethical Boundary / Protection",  # ΛNOTE: Represents an active safety measure, an ethical rule being enforced, or a protective mechanism.
    "🌱": "Emergent Property / Growth / New Potential",  # ΛNOTE: Symbolizes new capabilities, learning, or the beginning of a new symbolic structure. Related to #ΛSEED for new growth.
    "❓": "Ambiguity / Uncertainty / Query Point",  # ΛNOTE: Indicates a point of low confidence, missing information, or a query being posed by the system.
    "👁️": "Observation / Monitoring / Awareness State",  # ΛNOTE: Represents active monitoring of a process, or a state of heightened system awareness.
    # --- Glyphs formally added by Jules-06 (Task 191) ---
    "🧭": "Path Tracking / Logic Navigation / Trace Route",  # ΛNOTE: For #ΛTRACE. Symbolizes guided execution paths, structured event logging, and navigational logic. Origin: Jules-06.
    "🌊": "Entropic Divergence / Gradual Instability / Drift Point",  # ΛNOTE: For #ΛDRIFT_POINT. Symbolizes gradual deviation, flow, or potential instability not yet a full collapse. `🌪️` is for acute collapse. Origin: Jules-06.
    "⚠️": "Caution / Potential Risk / Audit Needed",  # ΛNOTE: For #ΛCAUTION. A universally recognized symbol for potential hazards, areas requiring special attention, or conditions needing audit. Origin: Jules-06.
    "📝": "Developer Note / Insight / Anchor Comment",  # ΛNOTE: For #ΛNOTE. Visually distinguishes significant human-authored annotations, insights, or anchor points in code/diagrams. Origin: Jules-06.
    "✨": "Emergent Logic / Inferred Pattern / Novel Synthesis",  # ΛNOTE: For #AINFER. Denotes points where logic is inferred, behavior is emergent, or new patterns/solutions are synthesized (e.g., AI model outputs). Origin: Jules-06.
    # --- Glyphs for Validation & System State (Jules-06, Task 192) ---
    "✅": "Confirmation / Verification Passed / Logical True / Integrity OK",  # ΛNOTE: For #ΛVERIFY. Universally understood symbol for success, confirmation, and verified state. Origin: Jules-06.
    "☣️": "Data Corruption / Symbolic Contamination / Invalid State / Integrity Compromised",  # ΛNOTE: For #ΛCORRUPT. Biohazard symbol conveys danger from compromised data/symbol integrity. Origin: Jules-06.
    "🔱": "Irrecoverable Divergence / Major System Fork / Entropic Split / Path No Return",  # ΛNOTE: For #ΛENTROPIC_FORK. Trident symbolizes a multi-pronged, powerful split beyond simple drift or singular collapse. Origin: Jules-06.

# FILENAME: glyphs.py
# VERSION: 0.1.0 (Initial Definition by Jules-06)
# TIER SYSTEM: CORE_SYMBOLIC_REPRESENTATION
# ΛTRACE INTEGRATION: ENABLED
# CAPABILITIES: Defines and provides access to a centralized map of symbolic glyphs.
# FUNCTIONS: get_glyph_meaning (example accessor)
# CLASSES: N/A
# DECORATORS: N/A
# DEPENDENCIES: structlog, typing
# INTERFACES: GLYPH_MAP is the primary interface, intended for import by other modules.
# ERROR HANDLING: get_glyph_meaning returns a default for unknown glyphs.
# LOGGING: ΛTRACE_ENABLED (structlog). Logs module initialization and map definition.
# AUTHENTICATION: N/A
# HOW TO USE:
#   from core.symbolic.glyphs import GLYPH_MAP, get_glyph_meaning
#
#   bifurcation_glyph = "☯"
#   meaning = GLYPH_MAP.get(bifurcation_glyph)
#   # or
#   meaning = get_glyph_meaning("🪞")
#   log.info(f"The glyph {bifurcation_glyph} symbolizes: {meaning}")
# INTEGRATION NOTES:
#   - This map is intended to be expanded and curated.
#   - Other modules can import GLYPH_MAP to use these symbols consistently.
#   - Consider versioning or more dynamic loading if the map becomes very large.
# MAINTENANCE:
#   - Add new glyphs with clear, concise conceptual meanings.
#   - Ensure meanings align with LUKHAS-wide symbolic conventions.
#   - Consider potential for localization or alternative representations in the future.
