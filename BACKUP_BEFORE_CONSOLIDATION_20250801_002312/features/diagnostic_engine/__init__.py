# MODULE: core.diagnostic_engine
# DESCRIPTION: Initializes the core.diagnostic_engine package. This engine is
#              crucial for symbolic health tracking, drift scoring, state vector
#              analysis, and loop validation within LUKHAS AGI.

# Define what is explicitly exported by this package
__all__ = [
    # e.g., "DiagnosticEngine", "run_diagnostics" from engine.py

# ΛNOTE: This package is intended to house the core diagnostic capabilities of LUKHAS.
# Modules within should implement logic for:
# - Drift detection and scoring (#ΛDRIFT_POINT)
# - System state vector analysis (#ΛSIM_TRACE, #ΛTEMPORAL)
# - Inference over system behavior (#AINFER)
# - Identification of entropic zones or unstable loops (#ΛENTROPIC_ZONE)
