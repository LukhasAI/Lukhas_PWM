## 1. Introduction – What is Symbolic Glyph Guidance?

This Symbolic Glyph Guidance Handbook serves as a companion to the `GLYPH_MAP` (defined in `core/symbolic/glyphs.py`) and the `GLYPH_CONFLICT_POLICY.md`. While `GLYPH_MAP` provides the direct association between a Unicode glyph and its core concept, this handbook aims to:

-   **Elaborate on Interpretive Depth**: Explain the intended semantic layers and nuances behind glyph usage.
-   **Guide Consistent Application**: Offer best practices for how human developers and future symbolic agents should use and interpret these glyphs.
-   **Enhance Symbolic Clarity**: Ensure glyphs contribute effectively to LUKHAS's goal of `#ΛSYMBOLIC_UNITY` by reducing ambiguity and fostering shared understanding.
-   **Mitigate Misuse**: Provide context to help avoid semantic drift or the misapplication of glyphs.

Glyphs in LUKHAS are more than mere icons; they are intended as concise, potent carriers of symbolic meaning, designed to make system states, processes, and logs more immediately intelligible and to provide a common visual language for complex AGI concepts.

## 2. Interpretation Layers

The meaning of a LUKHAS glyph can be understood across several layers:

-   **Layer 1: Surface (Visual/Emoji)**
    *   **Description**: The most immediate, literal, or commonly understood meaning of the Unicode emoji or symbol.
    *   **Example**: `✅` is widely recognized as "yes," "correct," or "done."
    *   **Utility**: Provides instant, low-effort recognition for common states.

-   **Layer 2: Mid-Layer (LUKHAS Symbolic Association)**
    *   **Description**: The specific, defined meaning within the LUKHAS context, as primarily outlined in `GLYPH_MAP`. This is the canonical meaning for system operations and documentation.
    *   **Example**: `✅` in LUKHAS (`#ΛVERIFY`) specifically means "Confirmation / Verification Passed / Logical True / Integrity OK." `☣️` (`#ΛCORRUPT`) means "Data Corruption / Symbolic Contamination," not necessarily a literal biological hazard.
    *   **Utility**: Standardizes LUKHAS-specific concepts.

-   **Layer 3: Deep-Layer (Cognitive & Agentic Implications)**
    *   **Description**: The potential impact or implication of the glyph-associated state on LUKHAS's cognitive processes, agentic behavior, or overall system health. This layer considers the "so what?" of a glyph appearing.
    *   **Example**:
        *   `🌪️` (`#ΛCOLLAPSE_POINT`): Surface = tornado; Mid-Layer = "Acute collapse risk"; Deep-Layer = May trigger immediate resource reallocation, entry into a safe-mode cognitive loop, or alert human overseers due to high cognitive load and potential for systemic failure.
        *   `🪞` (`#ΛREFLECT`): Surface = mirror; Mid-Layer = "Symbolic Self-Reflection"; Deep-Layer = System is engaging meta-cognitive processes, potentially re-evaluating recent actions or learning from internal simulations, which might temporarily alter its responsiveness or resource usage.
    *   **Utility**: Informs both human understanding of system dynamics and provides semantic richness for advanced agentic interpretation and response.

## 3. Glyph Classes & Usage Examples

Glyphs can be grouped by their primary function or the type of concept they represent. This aids in understanding their role within the symbolic ecosystem.

### Class: System State & Validation
*Purpose: Indicate current operational status, integrity checks, or critical system conditions.*

-   **`✅` (`#ΛVERIFY`): Confirmation / Verification Passed**
    *   **Usage Example**: `log.info(f"{GLYPH_MAP.get('✅')} Integrity check for module_A passed.", component="ModuleA", status="VERIFIED")`
    *   **Tag Chain Example**: `#ΛTRACE 🧭 → ModuleA.run_check() → #ΛVERIFY ✅`

-   **`☣️` (`#ΛCORRUPT`): Data Corruption / Symbolic Contamination**
    *   **Usage Example**: `log.error(f"{GLYPH_MAP.get('☣️')} Memory segment 0xDEADBEEF failed CRC. Data potentially corrupt.", segment="0xDEADBEEF", event="CORRUPTION_DETECTED")`
    *   **Tag Chain Example**: `#ΛMEMORY_ACCESS → #ΛCORRUPT ☣️ → #ΛSAFETY_MEASURE 🛡️ (isolate segment)`

-   **`⚠️` (`#ΛCAUTION`): Caution / Potential Risk / Audit Needed**
    *   **Usage Example**: `log.warning(f"{GLYPH_MAP.get('⚠️')} High resource usage detected: CPU at 95%.", resource="CPU", usage="95%")`
    *   **Tag Chain Example**: `#ΛRESOURCE_MONITOR 👁️ → #ΛTHRESHOLD_EXCEEDED → #ΛCAUTION ⚠️`

### Class: Process & Flow
*Purpose: Represent movement, transformation, or the nature of ongoing processes.*

-   **`🧭` (`#ΛTRACE`): Path Tracking / Logic Navigation**
    *   **Usage Example**: `log.debug(f"{GLYPH_MAP.get('🧭')} Entering function process_payment.", function="process_payment")`
    *   **Tag Chain Example**: `#ΛAPI_CALL 👁️ → #ΛTRACE 🧭 (process_payment) → #ΛDB_WRITE ...`

-   **`🔁` (`#ΛDREAM_LOOP`): Dream Echo Loop / Recursive Feedback**
    *   **Usage Example**: `log.info(f"{GLYPH_MAP.get('🔁')} Starting dream cycle {dream_id}, incorporating feedback from previous cycle.", cycle_id=dream_id)`
    *   **Tag Chain Example**: `#ΛDREAM_INITIATE → #ΛTRACE 🧭 (dream_cycle) → #ΛDREAM_LOOP 🔁 → #ΛLEARNING_UPDATE 🌱`

-   **`✨` (`#AINFER`): Emergent Logic / Inferred Pattern**
    *   **Usage Example**: `log.info(f"{GLYPH_MAP.get('✨')} Inferred user intent: 'query_balance' with confidence {conf:.2f}.", intent="query_balance", confidence=conf)`
    *   **Tag Chain Example**: `#ΛNLP_PROCESS → #AINFER ✨ (intent: query_balance) → #ΛACTION_DISPATCH`

### Class: Symbolic & Cognitive Concepts
*Purpose: Represent abstract AGI concepts, learning, or internal states.*

-   **`🪞` (`#ΛREFLECT`): Symbolic Self-Reflection / Introspection**
    *   **Usage Example**: `log.info(f"{GLYPH_MAP.get('🪞')} Initiating self-reflection on recent performance anomalies.", context="performance_review")`

-   **`🌱` (`#ΛSEED`): Emergent Property / Growth / New Potential**
    *   **Usage Example**: `log.info(f"{GLYPH_MAP.get('🌱')} New behavioral pattern 'adaptive_greeting' seeded and activated.", pattern_id="adaptive_greeting")`

-   **`🔗` (`#ΛSYMBOLIC_UNITY`): Symbolic Link / Connection / Unification**
    *   **Usage Example**: `log.info(f"{GLYPH_MAP.get('🔗')} Symbolic bridge established between 'ontology_A' and 'ontology_B'.", bridge_type="semantic_equivalence")`

### Class: Risk & Instability
*Purpose: Highlight potential or actual system instability or divergence.*

-   **`🌊` (`#ΛDRIFT_POINT`): Entropic Divergence / Gradual Instability**

-   **`🌪️` (`#ΛCOLLAPSE_POINT`): Acute Collapse Risk / High Instability**
    *   **Usage Example**: `log.critical(f"{GLYPH_MAP.get('🌪️')} Reasoning loop depth limit exceeded. Potential cognitive collapse.", loop_id="reasoner_alpha", depth=max_depth)`

-   **`🔱` (`#ΛENTROPIC_FORK`): Irrecoverable Divergence / Major System Fork**
    *   **Usage Example**: `log.critical(f"{GLYPH_MAP.get('🔱')} System has forked into conflicting operational states due to irreconcilable sensor data. Manual intervention required.", state_A="SENSOR_ARRAY_PRIMARY", state_B="SENSOR_ARRAY_BACKUP")`

## 4. Agent and Human Interactions

-   **Human Interpretation**:
    -   Humans reviewing logs, traces, or documentation should use this guide and `GLYPH_MAP` to quickly assess the nature of logged events or documented states.
    -   Glyphs provide an "at-a-glance" understanding, but should always be considered alongside accompanying log messages, ΛTAGS, and contextual data.
    -   The "Deep-Layer" interpretation can help humans anticipate system behavior or understand the severity/implications of certain glyph-marked events.

-   **Agent Interpretation (Conceptual)**:
    -   Future symbolic agents within LUKHAS might "simulate understanding" by:
        -   **Prioritizing actions**: An agent might escalate tasks or change its processing strategy based on glyphs like `🌪️`, `☣️`, or `🔱`.
        -   **Modifying behavior**: The appearance of `🪞` might trigger an agent to pause operational tasks and engage in internal state analysis.
        -   **Learning/Adaptation**: Glyphs like `🌱` or `✨` could flag events as significant for learning or model updates.
        -   **Communication**: Agents might use glyphs in their own internal logging or inter-agent communication to convey complex states concisely.
    -   The glyph system forms a part of the semantic environment agents operate within.

## 5. Semantic Misuse & Overlap Risks

While glyphs aim for clarity, misuse can lead to confusion. Examples of misuse:
-   Using `✅` to confirm a task that completed but resulted in a corrupted state (where `☣️` would also be relevant). The log should ideally show both if applicable, or prioritize the more critical glyph.
-   Overusing a generic glyph like `💡` (Insight) for minor informational logs, diluting its meaning.

This guidance document, in conjunction with the formal `GLYPH_CONFLICT_POLICY.md`, aims to minimize such risks. When in doubt about the appropriate glyph, refer to the primary concept in `GLYPH_MAP` and consider the most salient aspect of the event/state being represented.

## 6. Emergent Meaning & Symbolic Drift of Glyphs

It is acknowledged that the "Deep-Layer" meaning and even the common usage patterns of glyphs may evolve as LUKHAS develops. A glyph might accumulate additional symbolic weight or nuance over time through repeated association with particular system behaviors or critical events.
-   **Example**: `🌪️` might initially just mean "collapse risk." Over time, if it frequently appears in logs preceding specific types of recursive failures in the reasoning engine, it might implicitly become associated with "reasoning loop despair state" for experienced developers or advanced diagnostic agents.

This emergent meaning is a natural part of a living symbolic system. However, it necessitates:
-   **Periodic Review**: The `GLYPH_MAP` and this guidance should be periodically reviewed to ensure definitions remain accurate and capture significant emergent meanings.
-   **Documentation Updates**: If a glyph's effective meaning significantly drifts or expands, this document and `GLYPH_MAP` comments should be updated.
-   **Community Consensus**: Changes to established glyph meanings should be discussed and agreed upon to maintain `#ΛSYMBOLIC_UNITY`.
